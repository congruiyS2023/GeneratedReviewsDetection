"This thing doesn't handle well at all because the handle is skinny and the barrell is heavy. Also it just doesn't get as hot as any of the other tools I have. I'm just discovering that its not the company because I bought another smaller one that works fine .I should have returned this particular one and I cant suggest it to anyone.

edit 9/4/2012: The coating is starting to come off under the clamp. I've only used it 4 times. I would suggest getting babyliss instead.",original

I don't think that the product was ready for distribution.  On a positive note Quicken has put out several updates but there is more to do.  I think that if Quicken had serious competition they would either improve or die on the vine.  I have been using Quicken for over ten years and yet continue to upgrade nearly every year in spite of the short comings.,original
"I have been using Kaspersky for over 5 years and have not had a single virus, so it continues to be my choice for virus protection. I am really disappointed and frustrated with this version...it significantly slows down the loading of websites.  Turn it off and they load right up.  Turn it back on and the slow loading commences.
Until they fix this, I can't give it a higher rating than 2-stars.

"What can I say it's Microsoft,  No matter what they do it will never play correctly with MAC
I had a older version (Office 2004) installed then upgraded to 2011.  I can tell you it was a pain in the rear for a while.  I needed to Sync the old Office to the new and what transpired for the next few days was very bothersome.  Pop up windows appearing stating that the old Office was not supported, the proceeded to up date my calendar about 30+ times, what a mess deleting all the crap.  Now that I retrieved all the info I need and turned off Sync no more pop ups but it was a pain.
And why can't Microsoft distribute the whole package in one? you either have to buy the office for business or up grade so you can get the mail program.",original
"December 12, 2014
My wife and I have been using Quicken almost daily for more than 15 years. As I said in the January update the budget module in the 2014 version is very difficult to use. I find that the only way I can do what I want to is to have a pen and paper next to me, and a calculator on screen. The problem is trying to manage budgets month to month.

I can't use the method designed into the program because it is an annual method (Details layout). If we overspend one month and look all the way to the right what I see is the amount over or under budget, which I already knew. That is of no help to me.

Lets say we budget $100/mo which is $1,200/year. If we under-spend in January by $10 I want to change the January budget to $90 and make February $110. As soon as I set the January budget amount to 90 the column all the way to the right tells me I'm on budget and showing a $0 balance - which I am momentarily - but I've lost the amount that I'm wanting to move to February. All I have in the balance column is $0. Useless.

What I had in the 2011 version was the yearly budget amount, in this case $1,200. When I changed January to $90 the total budget amount would change to $1,190. That told me I had $10 more to add to Feb. I've lost that data. Hence the pencil and paper. It's no small thing because we have about 50 categories and the way Quicken budgeting is designed my time doubles to use the budgeting.

In the 2014 design I have to scroll right to see the ""Balance"" as it is hidden unless I have a wide enough screen. In the 2011 version I could have two windows open, one with the budget and one with the actuals. I could see all of the columns I wanted to. That isn't possible in the 2014 budget.

Budgeting is why we bought the program - and it's broken (in my opinion) in the 2014 version. The 2011 version was MUCH better.

If Intuit would simply add a column showing the total budgeted amount they can keep the balance column and I'd be happy. Also I'd want the Budgeted amount locked on the screen so it didn't scroll with the months. I always want to see that right most column.

Scrolling is another area that is a mess in 2014. In the Details budget view if I'm looking at the November data it will often scroll back to January when I operate the scroll bar or the mouse wheel. Honestly I don't know what the formula is to make that happen because it doesn't happen all of the time. But it certainly is annoying because I think I'm entering a number in November but end up in some other month.

I am so frustrated because we use perhaps 45% of Quickens total feature set, but the important ones that we use are a mess.

Jan 21,2014 Update
Ok I'm running into some issues. Budgeting sucks in this version. I really appreciated the simplicity and ease of use of the budgeting in the 2011 version. I'm forcing my way through but it is taking some effort and reading on-line other customer comments to get things working. This shouldn't be this difficult. The biggest problem is trying to see budget totals for the year.

The other thing I'm seeing is some things are very slow. I have a 2.4GHZ Quad processor desktop with 8GB of RAM and Quicken still struggles to produce some reports. Sometimes it takes so long I think the program isn't responding.

Original Review...

I was really worried about jumping from Q 2011 to Q 2014 after all of the bad reviews and user comments. But I was forced into it because of the three year timeout on downloading transactions - what a rip off. Frankly I'd rather just pay an annual fee and not have to update to the latest version of Quicken because of all of the complaints. However so far so good.

I downloaded Quicken 2014, knowing that I had to, and I could go back to Quicken 2011 for about three more months if I had to. But so far it has been fine. Q 2014 updated my database, asked me for some registration data, then promptly crashed when I tried to run an Update. I restarted Q 2014, it AGAIN asked me for registration data, and this time it didn't crash when I ran Update.

I took a look at budgets, they have changed (change isn't fun is it) but seem to work and I can live with it. I suppose the big budget fiasco happened in an earlier version and Intuit recanted and fixed budgeting so I may have gotten lucky.

At the moment I can't find fault with the 2014 version but I'm holding my breath and will report back here if I have new things to report.

I see nothing that would have encouraged me to upgrade from 2011 to 2014 so this is all about being forced to do the upgrade - hence the three stars.

I loaded the Quicken app on my Android smartphone but it wouldn't let me log in. Apparently the way the mobile device gets its data from my quicken database is through a cloud service. I'm not a proponent of pumping my personal financial data to someone's cloud no matter how many ways they tell me it is secure (120,000,000 user accounts were stolen from Target recently!). So the little Quicken app is of no use to me. Even if I was agreeable to uploading my data to a cloud the app doesn't let me work with my investment accounts. So in other words it is of no use to me all over again.

What I would prefer in a Quicken app is the ability to sync with my desktop or laptop using WiFi or a USB cable, and for the app to allow me to enter transactions which would then sync with the desktop. Oh Right that was how the Sony PDA app worked more than 10 years ago. I wonder if anyone at Intuit took a look at that popular app?

But as I said so far so good... Do you think there is a trust issue between me and Intuit? Darned right there is.",original

"Roxio Creator NXT (2013) is a simple and fast software suite for editing, sharing, and burning media including video, audio, images, and not just for video editing.  The core video editor is quite basic and, though having the essential editing tools, without a lot of advanced features rendering the whole suite inferior to CyberLink Media Suite 10 & 11 and - of course - more expensive CyberLink Director Suite, both featuring excellent PowerDirector.

However, learning video editing can be really daunting and Creator NXT is perfect especially for those intimidated by the task.  Though, it is a bit invasive and intrusive, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CyberLink-PowerDVD-14-Ultra/dp/B00JC5Y4FQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CyberLink PowerDVD 14 Ultra</a>, as it may relegate other related software to oblivion without asking, that should be appreciated by beginners who are confused by, and unable to answer, difficult configuration questions.

In the old days, Roxio pioneered the first convenient software for copying and creating CDs - Easy CD Creator, which dominated the market for years.  Since then mainly due to reliability problems, it was surpassed first by Nero, and then by CyberLink, which begun by developing the industry standard PowerDVD video playing software and subsequently expanded.  Though Creator NXT lags way behind any suite with PowerDirector, it has a capacity good for a simple suite, is easy to learn and better than Sony Movie Studio Suite and Nero 12 Platinum, and still retains... sentimental value.",original

"This a typical Quicken product. If you don't have online-backup you will have to go through a lot of hassle restoring your data.  Fortunately I have online backup from Quicken and it automatically imported all my data error free, even my preferences settings.  Another thing with Quicken products is they have almost nonexistant technical support so you are pretty much on your own, but I have had very litle problems needing technical support. I have had Quicken product for years and every year I upgrade it seems to get a little bit better and faster. I have never had a problem with my financial institutions interfacing with it. Another issue you should be aware of with Quicken, it has server issues and on an average their server goes down every 1-2 months.  It tends to stay down for 48 hours.  However, it seems to only effect the backing up function most times. When it is restored you can backup whatever wasn't prior to their crash.

The rubberized grip is so slippery. After getting out of the shower and using lotion or hair products, holding this super heavy hair dryer is so hard. It keeps wanting to slip out of my grip and I'm nervous I'll drop it.

"I had to come back and drop a quick review on my Turbo Tax experience. I read the reviews of all of those who were saying that they were having major headaches trying to get it to download properly, and install. Then I read the reviews from those who were saying it downloaded and installed without so much as a whimper; it all went smoothly, and only took a few minutes. I noticed that those who reported a no problem install were saying they were installing it into a Vista 64 machine.

I thought the detractors must have been missing a keystroke somewhere, and after all, by downloading I was getting the latest version. The CD that you buy had to be older, and you would need a download anyhow, so why not just download it in the first place? The price was close to the same, by the time you factored in the shipping from the third party vendor. So I bought it and downloaded it into my XP machine. That is when the trouble began. It had problems every step of the way. So I decided to uninstall it and try shutting off my McAfee antivirus, as well as my Scotty the Watchdog Win Patrol that alerts me, with options every time someone tries to install a program on my machine at boot up, eating up valuable resources. Sure enough on the first install, up came the warning, and I said ""Yes"" but it stopped installing anyhow, so I shut it off, rebooted the machine, and on the third attempt, even renames the prior download, so I could download a fresh copy. (I did get a file error message somewhere along the way, so I decided to get a fresh download from the Amazon library) Well after all of that, it still didn't work. Oh it finally worked, and the program came up, after waiting about 3 minutes for it to load, and then when it did load, and I clicked on start a new return, after about 5 minutes, I decided it was frozen, and I did get a few ""Not responding"" messages when I tried to egg it on.

So I went to my other XP machine with a 2.4Mghz CPU instead of the 2.0 machine I initially installed it in, (both had 2 Gigs of ram) and this time I couldn't get it to load. Amazon is very helpful in getting the download part to work, even on a busy Sunday, 2 weeks before the deadline, but getting the Turbo Tax program to work, well that was something else altogether.

So finally I decided to give it a try in my Vista 64 Media Center PC. I downloaded it and in the middle of the download I realized it was being downloaded and installed right in the middle of recording the TV show 60 Minutes. I also had my McAfee Antivirus software running. I decided not to interrupt it. I just let it run. It fully downloaded, and all the usual prompts came up, just like before, just a lot, lot faster this time, and when it was all done, it went online, did the updates, and when I finally clicked on the ""Start a New Return"" button, it instantly flicked over to the next screen. How about that, it worked perfectly. Then I copied last year's return over the Vista PC and it drank that up, and gave me the next screen etc. No matter what I clicked on it worked perfectly. The program was running like a banshee.

So, can we conclude that it works effortlessly on a Vista machine, but it has problems with XP (Wouldn't that be a switch to all those Vista haters out there:)? Or is something in the way I ran it causes me to have 2 failures trying to load it in an XP machine, but not with the Vista?
I had to come back and edit this because with some thought I realized that I had Win Patrol with Scotty the watchdog running on both XP machines, but not on the Vista machine. What Scotty does is stop programs from loading on startup without your approval. So it pauses the load, asks is it ok, then after clicking on Ok it did not resume. So the pause turned into a halt. So if you are running Win Patrol, right click on it on the task bar and choose ""Exit"" before loading Amazon's installer installation. I did manage to work around that, and was able to access the program, but it was running like it had a corrupt file in it. Fortunately Amazon allows you to download and reinstall.

I think people who have XP can chime in here with their comments, and maybe we can get ahead of this thing. You know, fellow Amazonians, helping each other out. So if anyone has gotten good results with XP, let it be known here.",original

"There is nothing drastically wrong with these cards.  My one complaint is that I still have some of the traditional size Hallmark Card stock and the envelopes that come with those have the Hallmark emblem on the back flap of the card.  Since I'm using the Hallmark Card software and card stock, it was an important element that made the cards look and feel more ""professional.""  The traditional size is not made any more, which is bad enough, but to find that these new Hallmark cards do not even have the Hallmark logo embedded on the back flap of the envelope was a disappointment.  This makes it so there is no compelling reason to buy the Hallmark card stock rather than card stock made by your printer manufacturer.  Supposedly, papers made by the printer manufacturer are made to work specifically with that brand ink so why bother to buy the Hallmark paper?  I did notice that the cards seem to go through the HP printer easier with fewer roller marks.  To me though, this is just a matter of two negatives cancelling each other out.  One, the Hallmark paper feels to me to be a bit thinner and the second negative is that HP printer design would leave any roller marks at all on photo card paper made by HP.  Not much of a reason to buy the Hallmark cards (but not much of a recommendation for HP photo card stock or printers when they can't even produce a card that prints perfectly when everything is in perfect condition on the HP printer.)",original

I used a lot, and it was fine.  The plumeria scent is a little heavy, though it wears off quickly.

"I purchased this software, after reading reviews that spoke highly of it. After installing it with no problems, I noticed the computer slowed down to a point, where the mouse pointer would not move.  After I noticed that the files were done downloading, the cursor would then resume moving. I also noticed that the bootup time was extended from any other software I had used, excluding the Junk software from Norton *which either blue screened or crashed the computer*.

The antivirus worked fine, but everything else was slow. The firewall would not work with my home network or my print server, so I had to eliminate that Pc-Cillin firewall from the installed software. I had tried repeated attempts with their tech services to no avail, actually a waste of my time.  They would advise me to do minor adjustments, even after I just got done telling them I had already did the adjustments. I spoke to 2 people, and they both spoke at a below layman type language, which amused me, since I actually seemed to know more than them.

I uninstalled this software and went back to Computer Associates EZ Antivirus 2005 and Sygate. Both work great and both hold up well against the many firewall and antivirus tests I have thrown at them.

"I'm erasing my former review, writing a new one, and changing my rating from 2-STARS to 3-STARS (meaning okay).  I think the program may possibly be doing what it claims so I also purchased usage for a second year.

I gave one of my older computers to a neighbor kid and used Drive Scrubber to remove everything from the hard drive.  I then used the software that came with the old computer to restore it to a like new condition.  I don't actually know if criminal investigators, or information hackers, can restore any of the erased data or not.  But for me, at least in this instance, it doesn't matter.

But understand, I cannot prove that the program actually works.  For sure, its not perfect.  For one thing, when I analyze a disk before erasing deleted data, its result is over-printed on the text and cannot be read.  This is clearly a glitch in the program.  It existed in the first copy I installed, and it exists in the new copy I installed after removing the first - even after downloading the newest version.  This glitch of course, could be caused by my own computer or other software corrupting the program.  I just don't have the computer knowledge to know one way or the other.

Anyway, the program is cheap, uses little computer resources, and may be performing as advertised.  I just cannot know for sure.  You pay your money and you take your chances.",original

"I've been using TurboTax and Quicken for many years and with each new version I buy, I edge closer to looking at the competition. This year's TurboTax is probably pushing me over the line.

  First, I truly hate the endless in-your-face advertising for other Intuit products. I am buying a software product and paying a healthy price for the usability of the software - not to have an endless stream of ads for other Intuit products shoved in my face.

  Secondly, TurboTax's help system is just plain awful. This is the first year I received Social Security payments - and I had questions about their taxability. I had to go through three layers of help menus before winding up with an official IRS publication. Why have three layers of superfluous inapplicable information?

  Intuit pushes a lot of the burden online for help, which is not the most efficient - or helpful - facility to use.

  Picking up your last year's tax return as a starting point for the current year is not a wise move. Better to start from scratch.

  The ""guided interview"" is ridiculous. A one size fits all approach wastes a lot of your time.

  Overall, I think this is my last year of not considering alternatives to TurboTax. Intuit has done a lot of rotten things to its customers. A few years back, they implemented a copy protection scheme that could cripple your computer. This year they implemented an outlandish charge for printing alternate returns. On both occasions, Intuit backed down with an explanation that they ""blundered"" - but not before trying to rip off their customers.

  Hopefully there is an equivalent or better product out there because I am fed up with TurboTax and its arrogance toward its customers.

"Update: I am much more fond of this than when I first tried it. It is definitely a geek tool, but I am, after all, a geek. I have an old copy of Windows 2000 running with SP 6 or so, no antiviral because I don't give it network access. It runs the Windows apps I need, like Microsoft Access. It can't handle the children's games unfortunately, maybe XP would allow a bit better results.
---

Download the demo version and try it out before you buy. This is not an application for the non-geek. If you're a geek (like me) it's not that hard to install, but the copious documentation is often incorrect. You're better off ignoring the documentation.

It claims to support Win95, 98 etc. I tried Win98 release 2. Don't bother. Seriously. It's a disaster.

XP works far better, but I think the current release has not been fully debugged for the newest Macs. I tried some older children's games -- the older they were the less they worked. They do work on an XP box.

Batteries go fast when running this -- you're best off with a plug.

"I have been using Quicken since the 2nd DOS version. I cannot understand how Intuit can mess up so consistently. Since the 2004 release, every update gets worse. This is up there with the worst of the worst. Good features that worked no longer work, little frustrating things never get fixed -- EVER! This goes on and on for years, and then more little frustrating problems get added. Over the years, I have sent Intuit a long list of items to fix. Never once have I received so much as one acknowledgement nor, to my knowledge, has one single item I have mentioned been fixed. I have not been asking for major feature additions or even enhancements. I have been asking for little things that any user would find beneficial. The irony is that I am a Software Design Engineer -- for about 30 years. So I don't send frivolous ideas.

Here are some annoying examples of the functionality that is now no longer working in 2013: Whatever category you had for your downloaded items before the 2013 version is no longer used. Quicken just seems to pick whatever it wants. In my case, everything is categorized as ""Income."" Also, if you enter in the category and memorize it, it still will not be recognized in the next download. If you rename payees, the renaming will not be seen by Quicken the next time that same payee is downloaded. If you click on a downloaded item in the bottom window that has already been Accepted, that item is no longer highlighted in the register. So getting back to it is time consuming and requires hunt and seek or search.

I wanted to have a separate paragraph for this one: speed. Or, rather, the complete lack of it. It is even slower than the 2010 edition - which was a dog. I have a 4.4Ghz hexcore Intel machine with the fastest solid state drive money can buy. I have 64Gb of very high speed DDR. Quicken is now slower than ever. I don't know what others are experiencing on older machines with slow, spinning mechanical hard drives and 1.5Ghz dual core CPUs, but it must be a special form of torture.

Now we are forced into an upgrade to keep our bank downloads. I call this extortion. The only way Intuit can get us to upgrade is to threaten to curtail downloading from our banks if we do not upgrade. Making a better user experience seems to never enter into their plans. Reporting to Intuit the problems and bugs is now so obfuscated that I do not even know how to do it. I have posted several messages to them, I thought, but they end up in some blog that generates user response. What can users do about bugs? Just ludicrous.

If you do not have to upgrade, then DO NOT. You have been warned.

(See my other reviews to know that I review a lot and have no particular bias to grind. If Intuit gets its act together I will give them a good review. One can hope.)",original

"In my view, this product is now useless UNLESS your computer already has Office 2010 already installed and you can merely enter the code you are buying with this product.  If you need to download Office 2010, good luck.  I am very computer savvy and found Microsoft now only supports 2013 downloads. I found other places where one could obtain links to download 2010 and used on that was supposedly relatively reputable. After installing the software and using up my code, AVAST popped up (love Avast) and said I had a rootkit type virus and it needed to run a boot scan on next start-up.  So, in my experience, this product is now useless UNLESS you already have 2010 Office installed (as in preinstalled) on your computer. Otherwise, you are taking a risk of finding a virus free place to get a copy of 2010 onto your computer.  (Or, it would also work if you have an Office 2010 Disk handy where that disk has been used but you can use this new code with it.)",original
"I was a loyal quicken user from the early 1990s until about two years ago, when I switched to MS Money.  Since that is now defunct, I am back to Quicken.  I am not a power-user and only use it to track account balances and monitor my investment performance.  A key function to me is the ability for it to communicate with my banks and update balances and transaction details.  The program does a thousand other things I simply do not care about.

My two gripes:

1) before buying I set up a quickenonline account (which is free) to make sure my banks were available for online downloads.  ING Retirement - my firm's 401(k) - was available on the free quickenonline version.  When I set up the quicken deluxe 2009 paid version, I could not locate the ING Retirement financial institution.  I contacted quicken support - which is based overseas and takes FOREVER to connect to via phone or internet chat - and they confirmed that ING Retirement is available on the free version, but not the paid version.  Feels like a bait and switch to me.  Oh, also I can't seem to get PayPal to work - but quicken says that is a ""known problem.""

2) the program is extremely slow.  I have a brand new computer with tons of ram and fast quad core processors.  There is no reason the program should take 10 seconds to load and a few seconds to respond to each command.

I'm diappointed.  The program does tons of things very few people use, but the basic functions are still not polished - even after 15 years or more.  Now that MS Money is out of the picture there is no competition and probably no incentive for them to improve.  Expect the cost to go up and the quality to go down.",original

This is literally the 2nd 1-star review (and I think the other person was wise for not purchasing).  I've grown even more skeptical and plan on returning this product unless someone from Opticover is willing to help out.",original

"I purchased this software from Amazon about two months ago, installed it on my vista computer and backed up my hard drive to an external drive. I had problems from the start, it didn't back up everything, confusing boxes I didn't check, confusing terms were used to describe the backup, confusing ways to check out what had been backed up. Finally figured out how to back it all up. Then disaster hit my Dell. The hard drive crashed, but WAIT! I KNOW A TRICK! I have a backup! Not so fast mister, popped in the disaster disk, loaded it up, got these really confusing terminology acronims, what the heck did it all mean? stumbled through the steps, got this progress window, it had two green bars in it, one said ""current operation progress"", the other said ""Total Progress"", the total progress bar filled up, it stalled on ""1 minute and 23 seconds left"", the other window was filing at the rate of wet paint drying, not even noticeable movement. I assumed it had hung up, tried it again, same thing, only now I noticed the movement and now assumed that they had the bars reversed in the window. I waited, i waited, 8 hours later it said ""FINISHED!"", Yes I shouted, I rebooted, I waited, the black screen of death, nothing,my new hard drive was as dead as my old one, I got out my trusty retired Toshiba and went to ACRONIS, searched the forums for an answer, there was none, there is no support there, none, I will now have to reload my hard drive from scratch, even the D drive was taken from me by ACRONIS 2009, what a swell program, thank GOD I got it at a reduced rate, a sale, a real steal.

Somehow I feel cheated, but then all I have to do is look around me at the world, look at what we have become, dependent on a stupid machine, its horribly written programs, its insulting support people, the ""figure it out yourself"", folks, who don't care if you ever come back. Cheated? Naw, I guess I got what all these other people got who gave this program a ONE STAR rating. I got nothing in return, I only wasted my time, probably less than a couple of weeks. I only blew $40 bucks, less than a full tank of cheap gas, not even pocket change for our new government. Is everybody happy now?",original

"I run Norton Internet Security on two 64-bit Vista Home Premium PCs.  It works great!  I'm impressed.  So I bought another copy to install on a 32-bit version of Premium, and a 32-bit version of XP Home.  It installed nicely and went about its business getting the latest updates and scanning my system.

However ...

I routinely right-clicked an icon on my desktop and Windows Explorer ""had to close"".  I tried everything I could think of, including pouring over Internet suggestions for 4 hours with no success.

Finally I rolled back to before I had installed Norton and Windows stopped being a jerk.  I googled for the error message with ""Norton Internet Security"" and found on a Norton support site that they were aware of the problem but there was no solution that I could use.

When a company reaches a certain size, it seems that they become incapable of fixing problems in their own products.

So, 5 stars if it works, and 1 star if not.",original

"The packaging suggests that it is possible to upgrade to Windows 8 Pro. It is not, unless you happen to have the appropriate ISO file in hand. Otherwise, your only choice is Windows 8.1 Pro.

"I recently was running 'AVG free edition' on my Dell dual core Vista PC with 3GB RAM. Just the other day, I was attacked by a 'Trojan' virus, which AVG could not apparently get rid of (I even tried a full system scan). I still kept getting pop-up messages regarding the virus and a new tab I never had before. I also had audio advertisements running without my choosing at times, even when I closed my browser! Talk about annoying. So I decided to can 'AVG' and go with Norton 360, which I downloaded. It seems to be working in some regards, but a full system scan took nearly 6 hours (5 hours, 50 minutes to be exact)! Is this normal?

UPDATE 6/26: Today, Norton 360 keeps asking me to re-start my computer, each and every time I turn it on!  2 starts every time I want to use my PC?  Are you kidding me?!  Ridiculous!  It also did not stop yet another Trojan virus, which it cannot 'quarantine' or get rid of.  Now I have 2 tabs i've never had before, and the ad music keeps playing again, even when i'm logged off of my 'Explorer' browser.  And 'Windows Security Center' does not work at all.  It has been disabled (I get a message stating that 'the security center can't be started').  I cannot turn it on or off, which includes updates and firewall settings too!  In addition, many applications run very slowly, or don't run at all when Norton is updating automatically!  You would think a 'full system scan' would have taken care of my issues.  There is a reason this crappy security suite is 63% off (at time of download)! What a waste of 32 dollars.  I am going to try Kaspersky, and hope it fares better than this.",original

"I am a serious user of desktop computers and have been for a long time. I own a small graphics company, small publishing company and I write for a living. I upgraded recently to a 64-bit 8-core unit that I built with the help of a software tech engineer. I've never purchased a ""brand name"" computer except years ago when CPM was the hot language of desktops. When DOS came along I started building my own. Each new upgrade is always a challenge since software makers are using more and more space to write less efficient software. That is, they dump the parts of software that are really useful and replace them with ""cute"" stuff that takes one, two, three or more mouse clicks to get to or uncover or work with than it did before -- and it always takes up much more space. Win 7 is an example of an upgrade that I refer to as a downgrade. I have been using XP Pro Professional 32 bit for a long time. I tried to install XP Pro 64 bit but it was totally chaotic, so I had to move into Win 7. I purchased my copy at Amazon. Frankly, I'd prefer to return it as ""broken,"" since I think it's a piece of junk. Apparently those who design today's working software (OS and other software) don't actually use it to make a living. In other words, they aren't self-employed and they don't find themselves relying upon a software to be efficient (time is money made or lost, depending on the amount of time a project takes). Certainly, those who designed everything after XP aren't using what they design to make a living . . .they just design stuff that looks cutesy. Take the icons in Win7. No more lists without large icons next to them and we can't make them smaller. No more Windows Explorer, either. Oh, they say they have it, but they don't. What  they have in place of WinExp is a piece of junk that probably works on an iPhone but not at all well on a desktop. I have this brand new high speed, 32 gigabyte RAM computer and it's SLOWER than the one I'm writing this review on. Yes, I have reverted to my 4 gigabyte RAM, 2-core, XP Pro computer when writing or cruising the Net or doing low space requirement work with graphics. On top of Win 7 being inefficient, Adobe has decided to change their software as well. I'm using CS6 on the Cloud with Win 7 and it's taking longer to get things done than with my older CS2 in XP. An example: Adobe dumped their extract from Photoshop and replaced with something that's, Yup, ""cute."" It doesn't extract well at all, though, so I have to keep this CS2 in this computer and do all that work here (Win 7 doesn't like CS2). Win 7 64 bit also demands a high price for replacing all software from the 32 bit, so even though they tell you that you can use the compatibility mode, it's a lie. Yes, you can install into it, but it runs at the same speed as your older computer whether it's 2-core or 4 or 8 core. Compatibility simply means yes, you can install here and using the (86) mode you can run it.

Bottom line is, there's way too much to list here that doesn't prove efficient once Win 7 is installed. I should have written every single major bump in the road down, but I didn't. I just packed up the computer and placed it into my wife's office and said, ""You now have the world's fastest email computer."" So, we have four computers here. Hers with Win 7 and all the rest with XP. Too many programs would not install and we lost the use of three peripherals including one printer, and two scanners.

So, we'll keep on working with old nuts and bolts on three computers and hope that someday, somebody will design fast, efficient, non touch screen OS software that really works and works with all our software. Microsoft has always been empirical about what they deliver to us, this Win 7 is an insult and of course, Win 8 is not even a suggestion for PCs.",original

It does what it's meant to do. I got it for my dad because he wanted it for extra protection. I personally find anti-viruses useless... it's for people that go onto random websites all the time and download too much porn or just simply doesn't know how to keep their computer clean. It won't stop someone from hacking into your computer if they really wanted to. It just stops the malware and some viruses.,original
"I'm currently pregnant and wanted to try this lotion on myself before baby is born. It is very watery but moisturizes well, a little goes long way.

I prefer LaVanila Baby Lotion much better-great ingredients and truly baby smell.",original
"PaintShop has a great feature set, and this version expands on that.  If only they'd pay attention to some details, this could be a 5-star product, but as it is, I will give it 3.  I haven't used it enough to encounter stability issues.  Once installed (on Win XP SP3) it seems to work, but the install had some confusing glitches and took a LONG time.  I have not tried to use the Project Creator.  For PaintShop itself, these things are annoying:
(1) the Organizer is a big step backwards.  You no longer have a filmstrip of images along the bottom as you work.  Instead you must switch back and forth between Edit mode and Organizer mode.  If the switch were instantaneous I could live with it, but it's painfully slow.  And as others have pointed out, if you were working on an say image 75 that required you scroll ahead in the Organizer, when you come back from Edit and want to get to image 76, well you have to flip forward again because the Organizer didn't remember where you were. (In thumbnail mode it does seem to remember where you are.) When you have images open and unsaved, there is no visual cue in Organizer mode, so it's easy to forget. when This combined with how slow it is really hurts the workflow.
(2) Express Lab is more powerful, and does have the filmstrip on the bottom.  You can now increase sharpness in Express Lab, but only by a fixed amount per click.  WHY don't the Smart Photo Fix suggested settings match the Smart Photo Fix suggested settings in Edit mode?  Why not a slider for sharpening?  And why don't all the standard Express Lab buttons fit in the default display (the Delete and Help buttons require you to click on the ""more buttons"" icon.  Better figure that you if you need Help in Express Lab...)  Express Lab would be a great workflow for quickly processing lots of images if only Corel would pay attention to these interface details.
(3) It's very slow to start, and seems a bit sluggish in operation.

Overall a useful product with excellent features at a very good price.  If Corel could just get it together to make the details be right, it would be a great product.  But as it is, 3 stars.",original

"First, let me begin by saying that I have been using tax software since 2000. First, I began with TurboTax and wasn't happy with the way it calculated figures to my disadvantage.
From then on I went with H&R Block TaxCut, now called At home. I must add I have no idea why H&R Block decided to change the name. I still call it TaxCut. I can't remember the ""At Home"" name. To H&R Block, changing the name was entirely stupid and a waste of time and effort.
Now to this program, I am dissappointed by the decreasing quality of it. First, DeductionPro, an useful program for valuating donations to charity was included on the disc. Then, I used it. Over the last few years, H&R Block decided no longer to include it. Now one has to go to the website to look up the info. Unfortunately, the info can't be stored on their server-what's up H&R Block??? Aren't you supposed to make things easier for the taxpayer with your software? Why are you changing things to make it arduous to do our taxes?
As if this isn't enough; the Deduction Pro one is a minor issure, really, though an inconvient one. While running this program to do my 2011 taxes, I found there were several areas where H&R Block didn't provide enough information, or no information at all to help me choose the appropriate answers to complete my taxes. I actually had to contact both the IRS and my state revenue office to locate the necessary information. Also, the program is supposed to choose filing options and deductions that would be best for you. I found that was not the case. For my state filing, the program suggested filing jointly as the best option with the most deductions. However, out of curiousity, I chose both to see if there was a difference, and yes there was. In choosing ""combined"", I saved $30.00 more on my deductions. So much for H&R Block choosing the best option for me. That says a lot about this edition of H&R Block. It isn't what it used to be.
Based on my experience with this year's program, I can't recommend it. It is still easier than doing it manually in longhand. However, now I can't help wondering just how accurate this program is now.",original

This version does work, and it converted my 2004 QBs well.

Almost all of my sales are online and to new people most of the time. This new QBs has you put in a default name for the shipping address, only an annoyance to me. I can see why some might like this. I'd rather see QBs volunteer the name of the account and the new, added name so I could just get on with it.

I keep my account names last name comma first name style. I would imagine that everyone would if you have a lot of account names. It annoys me to have to manually edit the display name when there could be an option to do that for me automatically. This is an example of something that seems to go on forever and never change.

I do find a little more flexibility in filtering reports than what I am used to.

All the nit picking aside, QBs remains the best and most cost effective accounting program for me. Accountants may like Peachtree and loathe QBs, but for a regular person who have several online businesses that I keep track of inventory and sales, QBs is the most convenient and cost effective way to do my books.

Would I like it if QBs would listen to me and to others like me and get the program even better? Yes, of course. Still the best option for me.",original
"=============================
My Final Opinion On Windows 8
=============================

I've plugged in the Windows 7 drive to access things on it, and I really don't want to plug the Windows 8 drive back in (even though I could simply take the cables out of one and put them into the other directly below it). Windows 8 really is a lame operating system; it should come in both desktop and handheld device versions, not a hybrid all-purpose version, but that's just my opinion. I gave it a fair chance...I got ""used"" to it...and still, I think it's a horrible implementation. I feel like I'm working from one convenient location again.

=============
Previously...
=============

I just need to add one more edit. My install is still fresh, yet I've come to a snag that has brought my system to a screeching halt. I'm unable to boot up at this point, and although it says ""Preparing Automatic Repair,"" no repairs are taking place. Enough trying to look for the good in Windows 8. It really is garbage. The start screen is stupid, and it has no place on a desktop machine. I guess it's time to install everything from scratch again, but that's okay, since I didn't get around to installing more than a couple of programs before this happened anyway. So lame.

I drop it down to one star, because the description for one star is considered ""I hate it,"" and I do. Even if this was working without incident, that when a product works as expected, that doesn't count toward an opinion of the OS. It really has been unproductive, inconsistent, inefficient and quite unnecessary in regards to what it has to offer.

==============
Prior Opinion:
==============

I like the operating system now that I turned the house upside down looking for my upgrade path. I haven't had a single issue with performance.

There are things I think need much refinement with Windows 8, and all of it has to do with the transitional elements. Though I've figure out where the options are that I wanted to manipulate, it was nowhere near being an intuitive process. The new Start Screen is like sitting on the internet all day; you get all the pointless fluff you would browse through on the internet, all in one place; only now instead of doing it at your convenience, your online presence is announced to the world the moment you log in to Windows 8.

I have the internet, but I don't keep important files on the computers that are connected - I only goof around on this [Windows 8] one. So what does this mean for our work computers? I'm not sure yet, as those are still on previous versions, but I've got to wonder what good live tiles are going to be on a computer that isn't linked to the world.

One common annoyance is when I go for the top of the scroll bar on the right side of any scrolling window, the charms menu pops out and is quite distracting.

Anyway, this is a great operating system for goofing around.

I bought this and opened it before Amazon added ""- UPGRADE"" to the title. Yes I read the upgrade notes, but I figured it was a message indicating that if I choose to upgrade a current installation, that my programs and their settings would remain intact after the process; there was no indication that I could not do a clean install on a new hard drive. I thought it was a great deal at almost seventy dollars being offered to entice those of us early-adopters who may be holding off because of all the updates and downloads that would be needed down the road. Well, it's still seventy dollars. Had they just put that down as the MSRP, I would have questioned it being a full version.

Although it has been made clear since, I am still stuck with an upgrade disk, which so far I'm not getting to use. Under normal circumstances I wouldn't ding a product that I haven't used, but I zoomed in on the pictures to make sure it was a full version and I didn't see ""Upgrade"" marked on the packaging, and that is Microsoft's fault, so yes, this product gets one star from me.

I have searched for a full version, and still this comes up as the most expensive Win 8 Pro at the MSRP of $199.99 - why would anyone have thought this isn't the full version?

I am furiously unhappy.",original

"I'm using Win7Pro x64.  When it works, it works.  However, incompatibility issues can make this version of Windows a nightmare if you have legacy USB and audio gear from previous editions -- including Vista.

Unlike previous editions, what I'm seeing with Win7 x64 is a very slow adoption rate by OEM manufacturers. In the past, they were all in a hurry to jump on the bandwagon.  I guess this time, everyone it tired of the game and holding off for as long as possible before supporting this new version of Windows.  Frankly, it looks like the same nightmare Vista users endured.

I wish I had held off this version of Windows until 2011. If what you have works, don't break it with an upgrade until you can go to the store and Win 7 support on most all the gadget boxes.",original

"I hate to say it, but this is not as good as MS.  It is a good basic word processor and spreadsheet program, but then again, so is Libre Office (which is free).

Although this may be because I am not used to the product, having used MS Office for the past 20 years.

I used MS Office at work and thought Corel would be a less expensive alternative when I had to bring some work home.  It has not worked out that way.  You lose much of the formatting when you convert from MS to Corel and visa-versa.

If you plan to use this product as a stand-alone program, then it should work fine for you.  But if you plan to share files with others running MS Office, it will be a problem.  Overall, I brought this when it was a gold box special for $20, so I did not lose much.",original

"UPDATE 4: I give up.  After months of frustration I've decided to throw in the towel.  Now all Corel does is load and not allow me to do anything.  Everything I click gives an error beep.  I have no interest in seeing if the latest version fixes anything because the version I paid for never really worked at a usable level.  PhotoShop, PhotoShop Elements, gimp, Serif PhotoPlus are much more viable alternatives to use.  It's so sad that such a great product was ruined by a company that puts ZERO care into their work.  Corel should just kill this product or sell it to competent developers.  I'm uninstalling this and never turning back.

UPDATE 3: Despite the adware (which I believe the complaints might have reduced), I decided to try to work with this.  I really think that it's sad that a piece of software that has been around for years and has been put up as a commercial PhotoShop competitor runs much more slow than its open source counterpart.  The UI may be better but all the loading and waiting kills that benefit.  I'm going to try to see if I can deal but at this moment, I'm actually starting to appreciate the lightweight nature of GIMP.  By the way, I switched to PaintShop Pro back in the day because PhotoShop was such a huge hog!  How ironic!

UPDATE 2: I'm sorry, I just had to add that I think it's really low class for software that I *PAID* for to have embedded popup ads in it!  If you want to advertise in software GIVE IT FOR FREE!  I had written the review before receiving two popup ads.  I'm sorry this is unacceptible!  I lowered the ranking one point as a result.

UPDATE 1: I found a way to mitigate the sluggishness of the navigator.  If you only stick to using the ""Computer"" tab in the navigator and don't catalog any of your images, the performance is okay.  Even so, the navigator is still pretty bad.  For instance, in the image viewer, there is no way to get to the editor.  You have to exit the viewer than right-click the image in the explorer instead.  That's just bad... REALLY bad.  I've also found that X6 can be default to open directly in Edit mode.  While not ideal, it is a step forward.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

The reason I ranked it three is because while the editor itself has improved, the navigator is just as dog slow as it has been since X3.  It is 100% useless.  The idea is that you're supposed to be able to bookmark folders in the navigator that  you can access quickly for editing and other tasks.  However, the execution of this idea is so pathetic they should have not even bothered.

This software could be five-star but the bloatware really brings it down two notches.  An ideal product would be just the editor and all of it's features alone without this albatross of bad software it is burdened to carry.  If removing the navigator were an install option, I'd gladly welcome it.

Now the editor itself has really improved like I said.  If you saw my X4 review, I had said that the context menus made absolutely no sense and the UI was designed by rank amateurs.  This version appears to have addressed my earlier complaints.  While not ideal, the menus are more sensible and contexts properly applied.  The toolset is pretty sharp, I LOVE adjustment layers, and overall I'm impressed with the improvement on the edit side.  Unfortunately, the excess baggage of the Navigator (Manage Tab) weighs it down.  Just avoid it at all costs.  I really wish there was a way to just rip it out.  It's just that horrible.

To be honest the real reason I bought this was that the price was low enough (thirty) to take the risk given that the previous versions were horribly bad.  I was also getting tired of using the kludgy interface of GIMP.  The extras like FaceFilter and Perfectly Clear add to the value of the package but I would not pay much more than what I paid for it.

So in a nutshell here's why you buy PaintShop Pro X6:

1) Tired of the GIMP UI
2) Adjustment layers
3) Heavy discount

The bottom line is what price you're willing to pay to not have to deal with GIMP's quirks.  You can get just about the same quality of image editing out of GIMP but some of its quirks are pretty unbearable.  PaintShop Pro eliminates that burden at the cost of heavy bloat.  Although it's not as bloated as PhotoShop the mother of all bloatware.",original

"The Step-by-Step Interview doesn't allow Invesment Management expenses to my broker (it puts an error message concerning investment interest when I am working in the investmetn expense catagory) and does not link to the Foreign Tax credit form as it states it should.  If I didn't know the IRS system better than the Step-by-Step Inverview, I would have been charged an extra $1700 in taxes.  No mistakes on the calculations; just that the proper information could not be entered during the interview.  I had to force TurboTax to enter the information correctly using the FORMS entry.  Even then it put the dividends in the Interest column of the Form 1116 (which I had to OverRide).  I guess this does not violate their accuracy guarantee, because it would not cause you to have a penalty with the IRS, but the effect is still too much money leaving my pocket.  From the TT Live Community I found that the foreign Tax credit problem has been a multiyear problem that has not been fixed.  WHY???

Also the Business version WILL NOT IMPORT from a Brokerage.  How many businesses and Trusts have investment transactions?  I bet a large percentage do; but it will not import from the brokerages like the Personal Version of TurboTax.",original

"I've had this for about a year now and I have to be honest, I rarely use it. It's thick and sticky and although it's moisturizing to a certain degree, I don't feel it lives up to its promises and I don't feel it enhances anything. It has a weird floral scent which is not at all a scent I want on my lips by any means. Some may like it and that's totally fine, it's just too much of a perfumey floral for my taste.

My biggest gripe with this product though is that it produces a white milky cast which worn by itself washes out my natural lip color and when worn over any other lip color it affects the overall shade of whatever it is I'm wearing and makes it look lighter.  So, if I use it at all it's before bed and honestly that is pretty rare since I'll reach for just about anything else over this.

"Horrible, and I've only had it for 24 hours.

Summary:

Kaspersky ""total"" allowed vicious malware from Filezilla, an FTP program that now contains malware which prevents you from using Google!  I spent over an hour online with 3 different support people, and the last one said it would take 24-48 hours to fix it!  Internet research shows this problem has been around for 3 months

Details:

I was setting up a brand new machine from Dell.

In the first day, when I installed FileZilla, from FileZillas site, it puts this evil malware called Vosteran on your machine that takes over as a search engine.  Even if you go into Chrome to remove it, it adds itself back in.  Vosteran is evil, and FIlezilla sold out in Sept of 2014, as Wikipedia shows.

Simple problem, and 3 months old, but Kaspersky didn't stop it.

Even after creating an account at Kaspersky, you cant make comments on their web page (find out later you needed to verify by email, but they don't tell you that up front).

Called Kaspersky, and the woman spoke softly and couldn't understand me due to her accent, so I asked to speak to someone else. She wouldnt let me speak to someone else!

She couldn't fix the problem, and said shed send me an email about how to fix the problem, because for some reason, they don't put the solution online.  Of course, they also allowed the malware onto my machine.

The next person told me that there would be an additional charge if their technical support had to solve the problem (that they originally caused because their Total security didn't stop the malware).  Amazing.

The email didn't arrive, and she hung up on me.

The next guy didn't speak English well either, and said he sent me an email.  By this point, Id gotten about 8 emails from Kaspersky, from their forums that I tried to sign up for which were sending verification emails, which they never said they were sending, which was the reason that they didn't let me make comments, and finally, one from the previous woman, which came about 15 minutes late).

The 2nd guy escalates to a 3rd woman, who says I have to run a program, send them a log file, and then wait 24-48 hours to get a response.

Just got an email  THEY CLOSED MY CASE, and its still not solved.

Total time wasted SO FAR trying to get rid of malware Kaspersky should have prevented in the first place: THREE HOURS",original

"Program refuses to install.  Hangs up and stops at about the 80 % point.  My machine is a pretty vanilla Windows 7 X64 with an AMD processor.  I've not had any other programs (of about 25 or so) that fail to install.  Typical lousy Acronis product.

If they would just write a program that didn't rely on a large number of Microsoft add-ons and libraries, it might work.  As it is, there is always another reason why it won't install.  Fix one, and another shows up.

Poor program to begin with, and this version will just waste your time.

Suggest something else unless you have a fondness for pain, or need a new hobby.

If you are dead set on using this, I suggest that you download the trial version and see if it will work on your machine.  If it does, and you actually like it, you can by the program and just enter the product key (which is a 64 DIGIT ALPHANUMERIC CODE!!!!!).",original

"My wife needed new software and my mom had just purchased a new computer with Windows 8 home, so I decided to get this to assist my mother, who is sharp, but not computer savvy. I have owned XP, Vista and have Win 7 on my other computers. Change is inevitable, so I got the Windows 8 Pro Upgrade. After hours of upgrading, including 8.1 and having to fuss with drivers for some of my other devices that are not updated for Win 8, I got everything running. It is now set up to resemble a reasonable facsimile of Win 7, so my wife did not have to go through the learning curve I did, and I can stay somewhat current with the new apps/icons/idiot pictures of Win 8. There are some annoying things about the new software that I don't like, but I am certain there are some things that make browsing and such faster. In the end, I feel the platform is less about technology and more about filling the coffers of Microsoft. At the end of the day, since the costs are about the same, you are probably better off getting this and setting it up with the free 8.1 download and modifying it for classic mode (Win7/Vista/XP), if that style is what you like. If you already have Win7, covet it and only let Microsoft pry it from your cold dead hands. :-)",original

"Corel has trod a long and rocky road. Way back when, Corel was a pacesetter, its CorelDraw product at the head of the pack. The company was led by a flamboyant entrepreneur who, with his glamorous wife, were regulars on the local high society scene. They are long-gone from the company. Since the high-flying days, the company has lost its dominant position and sometimes struggled for survival. Product quality and customer service deteriorated and I, along with many others,  stopped buying or updating Corel products.

 Along the way it acquired other brands, such as WordPerfect that had been managed even more poorly. Among them was a one-time shareware program called JASC PaintShop. At one time, PaintShop was actually a challenger to Adobe PhotoShop.  Corel also acquired a wonderfully innovative line of PhotoShop plug-ins known collectively as the KPT Collection.

  Once sold independently, Corel has not updated KPT products to run with Windows 7 and current versions of PhotoShop.

  They are offering the complete collection, however, as a part of PaintShop Pro X4 Ultimate. For the few dollars, because I wanted some of the KPT plug-ins, I ordered PaintShop Pro X4 Ultimate.

  Nasty surprise #1: the KPT Collection is not included on the installation discs. You have to register the product after it is installed to get a link to download the KPT product. In my install, the registration page didn't appear, so I went to Corel's site and registered the product. The registration site is brain dead. There is a single field for the serial number, so I entered the 28 character code. Then they tell me I must use dashes. There is a word for web design like this: stupid. Tell me before hand to use dashes or give me fields for each 7 digit string.

 No mention of KPT. So I go to tech support where I learn Corel generously provides me one tech support call for during my 90 day warranty period, before charging me $19 a question. There seems to be no provision on this page for email support. Uh, this kind of support is essentially worthless.

  I did find a page to email them a question. After filling out a dozen or so fields, I hit the Submit button and it tells me the product must be registered in order for me to submit a question. I registered the product already! I try registering the product again and it tells me I have already registered the product.

  Duh.

  I check my account summary page and - surprise - the product is registered.

  In other words, Corel has led me in a circle. I cannot get the KPT Collection without spending still more time with their brain dead website and support function.

  Lemme see: what takes less time? Printing out an Amazon return label? Or going through this futile process again?

  Guess which option I'm taking. With customer service like this, Corel is on the road to oblivion, regardless of how good a product like PaintShop Pro X4 Ultimate might be.

"I have mixed feelings about this product.  It has bailed me out from a C: disk crash.  However, I had many issues with the software (I will give examples below), support for problems is practically non existent (help only from the forums where other people are having the same issues)  and when the crash happened I had very little hope that it would work. But it did.  I now switched to a different back up method.

When I bought this software, I wanted to have a backup history of about a month so I can go back to the old files if I made some sort of mistake.  My hope was to run a full back up once a week, and then have differential backs 6 times a week, this way I could fit 7 different backups on a large disk designated for backups.  The software claims to have a function that allows it to delete old backups based on a condition (% of disk full for example).  But that never worked. Many other people complained about the same problem.  When the disk became full, it simply stopped backing up.  I had to remember to manually free up disk.

Then I upgraded to a next version of the software which was supposed to have these problems fixed.  However, the fix was to remove the functionality and what I wanted to do was not possible.  The new version still had problems with incremental backups at disk full situation.  In fact I left it double the amount of space necessary for one backup (as the forums indicated it needs temporary space while the backup is working).  Finally, the only solution that worked was to have a full back up every day, with a rule that the previous copy had to be deleted before the new backup was created.  Occasionally, it would still fail with messages that made no sense at all.  I could get it to work again sometimes, if I deleted several backups and ran disk defragmenter. But this did not always help.  And then in a few days it would begin working again.  So it felt fragile and unreliable.

As I was having various issues I contacted support several times (support is via email), they would get back to me in 2-3 weeks requesting some additional log file, to which they would respond maybe in another 2-3 weeks.  By then whatever they said was not relevant, because I could not just wait for 4-6 weeks for a possibly helpful response. I would just wipe out the backups and start all over.

Because the regular backups felt flakey, I also created ""secure zone"" back up, which is an option to have a backup on a separate partion.  When the disk crashed, restore from secure zone did not work.

So overall, using it was a very frustrating experience which was shared by a large number of other users based on the forum postings.  The forum was the only place where I could get ideas of for possible solutions, and validation that the problems I was having were not unique to me.

However there are some positive things about the product
1.  The feature that allows you to mount a back up and easily retrieve an old file as if it was just another volume is very nice
2.  The backups are fairly quick. I tried using Windows native back up and on my disks it did not even completed in 24 hours.  Acronis backup for all my disk completed overnight (when it worked), when it did not it would sit at the prompt complaining about something with inscrutable message.
3.  Finally, when the disaster struck and my c: drive crashed, I was able to do a restore my C: drive from the backup to a brand new drive and it worked.  I did not have to reinstall windows, all my settings and customization were preserved.

Bottom line, this is only for those who have no other options.  It requires constant baby-sitting.  You need to manually check if it worked on daily basis, delete files, and  just pay constant attention to it.  But what you want from a backup is to enable it and forget it until you need it.",original

"I made the foolish mistake of installing the free trial for 30 days, then bought the disk to install before the trial was over.

I tried installing the software (didn't uninstall the trial first) and now the software is asking me for a serial number (note that no serial number is provided on the disk or the box).

I contacted online chat that told me it should just install.  They advised me to call Applecare between 9am and 5pm (I work during the day - duh).  I guess the chat people don't have the authority to fix

"I wrote a very unflattering review of this product because, as I found out, the 32-bit version of the product must have had issues with residue from a prior standalone installation of MS Office.  I finally read a review that said something about going back to Office 2013, and thought...if only I could!  Well, you can.  Something that is not highlighted with this release is that there are multiple installation options, including an option to install Office 2013 32-bit or 64-bit, as well as a 64-bit version of 365 (and more), which I ultimately went with (despite warnings it could conflict with 32-bit software).  So far....Eureka!!!  It's working flawlessly.  After you buy the product, you don't have to install the 32-bit, which is the big, attention-getting button.  Look at ""options.""  Choose from among them.  Software itself gets a 4-star review, just because I don't know what conflicts I might run into that force me to go to Office 2013.  The process of getting from point A--can't run ""365"" (manifests as Office 2016 for me because this machine had a ""pro"" version of windows installed on it once upon a time) to getting working email, etc., has been nothing less than grueling because there's no walk-through up front.  That gets a black hole of suckiness.  Overall, a 3-stars.  I'll bump it up if deserved by the software once the hours spent trying to make this whole thing work lose their sting.",original

"What I like:

I like that the razor is adjustable and has numeric settings. Setting ""1"" is the mildest setting giving the least amount of blade exposure. Rotating the razor head will allow the head to raise exposing more blade for a setting up to ""6"".

The sound that the razor makes as it goes over whiskers is musical. The shape of the razor head creates an acoustic chamber amplifying the sound of whiskers being cut.

Open areas of the cheek are a pleasure to shave, and this razor plows right through. Definitely cool looking, and effective.

What I don't like:

Shaving under the nose. The razor head is HUGE, and that makes it difficult to get to tight areas such as this. I've cut myself while trying to shave under the nose as this is where the design is not friendly, or effective. I have to literally pull my nose up to shave my upper lip. The large head also affects shaving sideways and has cause a few nicks.

The handle is smooth, which becomes quite slippery once wet with soap. There is no knurling.

I still use it in my rotation, but it's definitely not the most practical razor I own, and not my favorite.",original

"How frustrating it is to get this stupid piece of software installed on my Windows 8 computer.  It freezes on the install screen. I have been working for hours, contacted both technical and customer support by email with no response.  Of course there is no telephone support either. Clearly other Windows 8 users have had problems since they have various patches and FAQs.  None of these methods work with my system however.  Now I have no video editing software and one expensive Frisbee.  Hope this gets resolved quickly.  (P.S.  My downloaded free trial had no problems.)  I am venting at the complete lack of customer support for a basic installation. It seems to me if Cyberlink is aware of installation problems, they should have live staff ready to help.

Update: 4/4 After nearly a week and many frustrating hours, Cyberlink sent me a new link for download.  I am raising my rating to three stars but will raise it again if it meets expectations. The trial version convinced me to buy it.  The slow response to my installation problem almost had me send it back.  Now I am guardedly optimistic that it will work out.",original

"UPDATE, 7/19/2012:  see the comments to this review from Acronis.  They claim the latest update to their installer was July 12, the day after my review below.  Well, they just sent me that latest installer, and it failed just as described below.  So a company which doesn't test its own installer, is not a company which pays close enough attention to the all-important issue of backups.  I won't do business with them.  Three times, same failure: with the initial CD bought here at Amazon, with the installer at Acronis on July 11 2012, and the one they just sent me today, allegedly dated from July 12, 2012.  Someone isn't paying attention to quality control.  Not good.

Important:  when you have a program like Norton GoBack, you can scroll back your drive to an earlier time.  You also get to see all the computer activity.  So this program never registered with Windows, and never installed icons on the hard drive before rebooting.  So it is not an OS or permissions problem -- I am the sole user of my machines and of course have full privileges -- but instead the programmer didn't write the program correctly.  And no one tested the installer prior to putting it on the internet for download.  Shouldn't have to require a customer like me complaining, for the correction to be made.  It should have been TESTED prior to release.  Again, not good.

UPDATE, 8/2/12 -- Acronis kept trying to blame Norton GoBack for the installation problem, again wanting to remotely connect to my computer.  This, despite the fact that I told them REPEATEDLY that I'd UNINSTALLED Acronis, a process which took 90 minutes, since only via Norton GoBack, could I uninstall it.  Now, here's the rub: GoBack records all computer activity.  So prior to rolling back the computer to uninstall Acronis, I VIEWED the activity of the installation.  Every file copied to temp files, then to the final directory, etc.  It never went through the function of REGISTERING with Windows.  It just rebooted the computer PRIOR TO registration, and of course didn't install any icons for Start Menu or desktop, nor offer the user the option to install icons.  All that activity and lack of activity, was IN the GoBack log.  So I KNOW what's wrong, and told Acronis.  Repeatedly.  They still kept writing me, until I finally refused to talk to them anymore about it.  So this kind of response, tells you much:  avoid Acronis.  Their Customer Service including two supervisors, don't even know computer basics.

So if your experience with Acronis has been good, fine.  Hope it stays that way.  My experience above and below, demonstrates a company which doesn't know its own programming.

So what is a good backup and OS/disc recovery program?  Macrium Reflect 5.  Works like a charm.  Just learned of it on cnet, and installed it, July 10, 2012.

Below, between the === 's, is the original review of Acronis.

================= original review of July 11, 2012 ==============

I made the mistake of buying this product some months back without using it, so of course now I can't get my money back.  WARNING: if you do as I did, you'll get a message on install telling you there is a later version, and recommending you select it.  DON'T DO THAT.  The later version depends on the program already being installed on your machine.  So it will seemingly install -- meaning copy files -- but will NOT register with Windows, and will NOT log itself into your Start Menu (on XP Pro, here), and will NOT create launch icons.

Adding insult to injury, this software has the longest product key I've ever typed, 71 characters.  Truly a pain to install.

So, if you're lucky to have GoBack as I am, you spend the next hour after the first half-hour's installation, uninstalling the program that way.  Since it didn't register itself in Windows, you can't uninstall it from Windows.  If you go to its Program files section and you click on its uninstall.exe, that program tells you Acronis is not on the system -- though it's IN the Acronis file under Program Files!

Okay, so if you instead install from the CD after rolling back your machine to before the 'later version' suggested as installation instead -- thus installing the earlier CD version -- what happens?  THE SAME THING.  So again you need a restoration program like Norton GoBack, to roll back your machine to pre-installation, else you can't uninstall a program which itself, doesn't know it is installed.  So you waste another 90 minutes.

Now, given the nature of this program, which claims to protect your files and computer, to copy sectors and partitions -- such a defective installation does not bode well for the competence of the program itself.  It claims to be able to do great things, yet can't even do a simple installation, or detect its own presence in a file folder?

Look: mistakes happen.  Programmer typos have big results and are hard to detect.  No problem.  But a massive oversight like this implies a systemic problem with the software.  Given owner complaints in the Acronis forum (at least they have one), it seems as though the systemic problem isn't getting the attention it needs.  These are life-or-death programs.  They need more professional service.  And, they should charge more.  Here, you waste $20 and three or four hours' time (so it ends up costing you $420, because anyone's time these days is worth $100 per hour).

My guess is that the url for registration is not included in the installer, or is defective, so it just aborted the install without telling you that's what happened.  So you think it finished installation, since it says it successfully installed, even when you ABORT the installation, lol.  So I'm sending this review link to Acronis, hoping they will respond and this can be fixed.

=============================

So don't make my mistake, and buy this program.  Closest thing to Norton GoBack (no longer sold, not good for Win7), is MagiCure  -- which can only be installed on Windows-alone systems, has an 8GB NTFS limit for storage, which translates into a one-day rollback. For a good DISK CLONING and backup program, get Macrium Reflect 5 Pro.

PS: Disk cloning of your root drive, is the only way to get back into operation 15 minutes after Windows crashes or your registry dies.  Basically, you CLONE your root drive to an external drive of the same size, and Macrium literally replaces the entire destination drive byte-for-byte, so it's an exact duplicate of your root drive.  If your target drive is SMALLER than your root drive, but the USED space is smaller than your target drive, the clone still works.  Macrium's disc cloning is swift, easy to use, and works well; but it is not automated.  I do it 1x per week, while watching TV; with automated disc-image backups on the other days.  Cloning 35-70GB takes an hour.",original

"I was playing around in the demo version of iWork09, and it seemed ok and according to the glowing reviews I ordered it. Mistake. Once I got into the pages program I stated to notice being told in apple support that ""No, Pages won't do that"". And I will list just a few things that pages does not do that Word for Mac does. I want the program to display full screen, cant do that, you have to drag and re-size the window each time, I want to set up my own labels, can't do that. I want a document that has both then envelope and letter in the same documents, can't change sections within a document. I wanted to set up my own format to display the date in a document, can't do that, you can in a table but not in a letter. You can edit the date but it gives you the same four 00/00/0000 format, or you can change the date to the time or change the date to the same date format plus add the time, who does that in a letter. Can not mix landscape and portrait pages in the same document. [...]  This is all fine for a letter to grandma, but anything complex, or even a little complex, it is useless.

Numbers is not as bad, so far, but I have not spent much time on it. I don't like the way it displays spreadsheets, I want a full page display. Not little groups of spreadsheets scattered around the desktop.

One telling problem with both these programs is looking in the preferences controls. There are almost none when compared to Word or Excel. As much as I hate Mircosoft and would have liked to migrate to an Apple product, iWork09 is not that product.",original

"I bought MacDictate after reading the many glowing reviews, especially from freelance writers like myself. After reading about the less than stellar quality headphones that come with the software, I decided to buy a Logitech model. The software came. It installed without any problems. I decided to use the headphones that came with the software to see if the reviews were right. Guess what. They were.

The next time I launched MacDictate, I set up a new profile with the Logitech headphones. Unlike the first session, the software picked up every word that I spoke. I blew through the training modules and was dictating my article within five minutes. What a huge difference from that first night! The software isn't perfect. Neither is the user.

For some reason, when I say ""paragraph"" the software doesn't start a new paragraph. Accuracy is about 80 to 85%, which isn't too bad for a first serious run. I will have to go back to the training section until I can iron out the problems. Despite the quirks and hiccups, I am happy with my purchase. I think that in a month or two, I will save a lot of time by not having to type out everything. I am not a slow typist, but I tend to self-edit as I write, which makes me a slow writer. MacDictate will help me change the way I write.",original

Unfortunately, I found the program to be somewhat buggy and cannot recommend it.

There were numerous, time consuming workarounds and fixes mentioned on the Video Studio forum. One user even solved his issue with the software by reinstalling his PC's operating system.

"I've been a Quicken user for many years, but am really ticked off at their upgrade policies. The best you'll get away with is repurchasing Quicken every 3 years if you want to retain the online banking feature. I presently run the 2010 version which works well. I see no reason to upgrade and agree with some other reviewers that Quicken upgrades rarely improve anything or add useful features. However, I now get frequent reminders that if I don't upgrade by April I'll lose the online banking feature. That is blackmail! If I ever find a decent useful personal finance program that supports online banking, I'll switch in a second without looking back. Mint looks decent but it is now owned by Intuit and will soon become Quicken. I used Microsoft Money a long time ago and would still use it if it had not been discontinued.

It deserves only a 1-star rating, but I give it 2 stars because I've had a good experience with Quicken 2010 so far.

11/27/2013 update: I compromised my morals and upgraded to 2013 because nothing else looked very robust. Lowered to one star because the 2013 version is not any different than the 2010 version, yet I was forced to upgrade to retain online banking. Idiots. I'd really like to monitor anticipated income and expenses easily. I can probably do it with Quicken but it is soooo cumbersome and takes way too much time and thought to make it work. Microsoft Money did it well but that was many years ago. We've come a long ways backwards with Quicken. Quicken 2013 also doesn't like the Quicken Exchange Format that one of my banks uses so online banking is only partially successful.

2/8/2014 update: Yet another reason to hope that Quicken or someone else comes out with a better product. I anticipate a budget crunch in 2014 to pay for unforseen federal taxes so I started a budget under Planning. They've removed a feature that previously existed! I'd like to specify the starting month for my budget but I'm limited to complete Jan-Dec years. I don't consider defining a date range for a budget to be an advanced feature. Another thing I'd like to be able to do is enter paychecks in as bi-weekly, not monthly. That is not possible with Quicken 2013 Home and Business.

Intuit is slowly dumbing down Quicken to the point were anyone can use it at a very basic level at the cost of leaving experienced users in the dustbin. The problem with doing that is once people own it and try to use it for the purpose it was designed for, they become experienced users and start looking around for something better. There isn't anything better, yet.",original

"BEFORE YOU UPGRADE:  stop by the Microsoft website and run the Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant (link in the comments).  This program will comb through your system and offer you detailed analysis of what will and won't upgrade.  It offers links to articles that explain in detail what you may need to do, and it can save you a lot of headaches.  For example, I have a laptop with no USB drivers--yet!  I now have a link to the manufacturer's website that I've bookmarked and when drivers become available I'll upgrade that machine too.

Windows 7 has been a well-received OS, so the case for upgrading to Windows 8 has been difficult for Microsoft to make.  While the look and feel of Windows 8 is strikingly different, for the most part it boils down to one huge change:  the Start Menu that we have had since Windows 95 is no longer a menu.  Icons are now displayed as tiles of varying widths in a full-screen splash.  Some of this makes sense in that some of today's programs are more like the Windows Desktop Gadgets we've seen in Vista and 7:  rather than needing to be launched, they idly stream information to you, and need a bit more room to be easy to read than the older Start Menu could have allowed for.  If you've used Windows Media Center, Office 2010, or an XBox 360, you've already been interacting with similar interfaces.  This sort of UI has been slowly making its way into Microsoft's products for a while now.

UPDATE: Amazon customer Robert Haines says that there is a program called ""Classic UI"" that would restore the old look, so if you're dead-set on new code that skips the new UI, you might want to try that.  There is also a program called ""Pokki Menu"" that will let you make your own customizations and last, Stardock makes a (paid) program called ""Start8"" that will also roll back the Start screen.

The Windows 8 desktop looks exactly like it did in Windows 7 and Vista, except there's no Start Button: you're expected to press the Windows key or move your mouse to the bottom corner of the screen to launch the tile dashboard. The desktop has the tray of running programs you're used to in earlier versions, shows you wallpaper, and offers access to the Windows Explorer for looking through the files on your hard drive. All programs can be launched directly off the tile screen, and while Windows 8 apps always run in full-screen, older programs run from within the Desktop and can be resized. We have a version of Internet Explorer accessible from the desktop that looks just like IE 9 did in Windows 7, then we have a version of Internet Explorer in the tile screen that looks entirely different.  Some parts of the Control Panel have the tile look and feel and the options cascade left-to-right like the Home screen in any MS Office 2010 or 2013 product.  Other parts of the Control Panel look exactly like they did in Windows 7 and before.  Unfortunately, I haven't found a good pattern for this yet:  you may flip from one side to the other in order to do something like troubleshoot a network problem.

Performance-wise, Windows had been slowly moving away from always-running programs that drain performance to background services that would launch programs as needed...but this too started to get unwieldy.  Microsoft have stripped several services out of Windows 8 which by default makes the OS more efficient than 7.  Any machine that could run 7 can also run 8.  Programs that used to run, shut down, then have to be fully re-launched to run again are instead put in a standby mode so they can launch faster when called again. The Windows Vista and 7 ""Aero effects"" that gave your windows a glassy sheen and rounded corners used graphics and CPU to run, so they've been stripped out of the tile UI in favor of simple color schemes and blocky edges (though you can still see a subdued glassy effect on the Desktop).  Interaction with Windows in this new look and feel is easier if you have a touchscreen or you're using a tablet, and if you're a Windows Phone user the territory is already pretty familiar.  The downside for mouse users is that you occasionally spend time hunting along the edges of the screen for scrollbars and dragging screens around to be able to interact with everything.  My chief complaint with Windows 8 hasn't been with the Tile layout so much as the fact that the scroll bars are too skinny.

For some features, time will tell.  I've found the Tile UI version of the browser to be less compatible and more cranky with websites, but I expect that to change given time.  I like the fact that security/antivirus are rolled into the OS without me having to take care of them or be interrupted with update notifications.  The OS runs Windows Updates on a schedule that's far less aggressive than previous versions and won't nag you about rebooting when it needs to.  I've been told that the performance for gaming is supposed to be greater simply by virtue of a cleaner codebase, but I haven't seen anything substantially different on the PC apart from faster boot-up and shut-down times (I did benchmark my machine with 3DMark11 and, after some adjusting, noticed a higher score).  The basic applications like Weather, Photos, Stocks, Mail, and more are very user-friendly, but solely within the context of the new look & feel:  expect little familar ground and a lot of new territory, and the assumption that you should be using a touchscreen.  If you have a Windows Live account and/or SkyDrive, these can integrate fully into the OS:  so much so that you would sign in to the computer with your Windows Live/Hotmail account and everything you do would be synced to Microsoft's cloud if your account has SkyDrive.

Windows 8 requires you to purchase a license for Windows Media Center separately; you still have Windows Media Player, but the Center is a separate application now, available for sale in the Microsoft Store.

UPDATE, 11/2013:  Microsoft has now released Windows 8.1, an update to the OS that mostly attempts to make the user experience better.  If you purchase this copy of Windows 8, you will be offered the ability to update it to 8.1 at no additional cost.  The upgrade is pushed through the Windows Store that is part of Windows 8.  Personally, I've done clean installs of 8.1 from the MSDN media and done an in-place upgrade via the store, on both my desktop and laptop, and have not had good experiences.  I don't personally recommend the update at this time for that reason.  Sooo....if you go the Windows 8.1 route, there is then a Windows 8.1 ""Update for Windows 8.1"" that you should probably pull down that puts one more round of fixes into the OS.  Reviews so far have been positive--minor adjustments like putting the power button where it's easy to find and making interacting with the Tile UI have been needed...but surprisingly it also lowered the OS' system requirements to where it can run on as little as 1GB of RAM.",original

"I wrote a review of this product a few months ago that dinged it pretty hard. I had purchased it, tried it and shelved it. I took it off the shelf after someone challenged me to try working with it and to review it again. Well, not much has improved in my thinking. A few things are a little more convenient (after you get accustomed to them) but overall the program is a drag on time consumption and ease for writers (authors). The 'ribbon' is okay, but it takes up room so in the end I dump it (hide it) and work without it until I need to use it. I convert books to eBooks and at that time the Ribbon is okay, but not more efficient than Microsoft 2000, actually making hyperlinks in 2000 within a document or to the Net is a ton easier in MS Word 2000 than in this version. For some reason Microsoft must have felt that hyperlinks should be made as difficult as Adobe makes them in InDesign. MS Word 2010 provides a neat image compression button for Web use and eBook use but does not resize them, so in the end I use Photoshop for that. BTW, you can resize the image for your local printer, but that does not resize it for the Web or eReaders. IMHO, 2010 is better than 2007 but fails to improve on Word 2000 and is therefore, just another change for marketing purposes and not necessarily for those who need to create material. I have Microsoft Office 2000, Word 2003 and Word 2007. I dumped 2003 and 2007 (uninstalled them) and now use MS 2000 for the bulk of my work. I have kept MS Word 2010 installed, but find that I don't gravitate to it, simply because my time is too valuable to put up with the geeky stuff.

Edit December 19, 2012: I have now had MSWord 2010 for about 8 months. For writing copy, books, etc. I still prefer MS 2000. For making eBook files for others I use the MSWord 2010. A few updates have helped with hyperlinks, but that's about it. The picture compression is handy for making eReaders like Kindles, Nooks, and other EPUB and iBook files. MS 2010 does open all older files and you can save them in the older version format if you need to. But I confirm again that MS 2010 costs too much labor time to switch copy writing or the writing of books and other large documents from 2000 to 2010.",original

"I've used quicken since the late '80s and loved it. I really loved when they added the ability to attach documents to a transaction. Now when you attach a pdf document, you get an icon on the screen, you can't see if it's the correct attachment. Worse, when you go back to check information on your attachments, you have to open quicken, open the transaction, open attachments, then click on the attachment to open the document reader to see the attached document. If you have more than one attachment, you have to open each one separately until you find the one you're looking for.
The mobile app would be really nice, if it worked. I used it fine, with most accounts, for a couple months; then the new year turned the calendar and quicken wanted me to upgrade to something I'd already been using for months. It wouldn't sync until I did, problem is, it wasnted me to sign on with the old account, but when I tried to do that, it wouldn't. I lciked for it to send me the password, even though I know what my old password was, but it wouldn't send me the necessary ""code"", so I resent, which was my only other option. well that errased everything from my phone app. I tried contacted tech support, first via online chat. I was 32 in line and waited 45 minutes for the count down to me being next, then got a message that no one was available to try again later. So I submitted my question to the call option and they sent me a number to call. I waited 1.3 hours, and never got anything but ""we will be with you shortly"".

To compromise, I had to turn off one of the major services on Windows 2000. Unless the company fixes this problem soon, I am gong back to Norton.
This particular problem may not affect you if you don't use the product on Win2K, but being a software developer, I extrapolate my negative experience to the robustness of the McAfee's products in general.

"I have used this program for two years and just bought V1.2 as a renewal for my three computers.  (It's been upgraded X times.)It has never made any of my computers crash, and while it does take more than one click to use, it is easy both to install and to use.  I think it works as claimed, but the Police have never taken in any of my computers for criminal investigation.  (THAT'S A JOKE.)

Actually, Windows Cleaner One Click does more than erase sensitive files, it seems to keep my computers running at good speeds.  I'm retired, live alone, and don't much care if my files are viewed by anyone else.  I just want my computers to run properly.  With this program, and Kaspersky's Internet Security, I have never had any computer/Internet interface problems.  But, you pay your money and you take your chances.

UPDATE 2/6/2012

After using this program for years I let it lapse for two months.  When my computer suddenly started taking more than 2 minutes to boot-up, I renewed my subscription ($9.99).  They downloade4d an update making it version 7.09.  The problem is it still takes me more than two minutes to boot.

Furthermore, other things I thought would be fixed was the section supposed to erase Invalid Registry Items.  It is presently identifying 82 items, and it indicates that they have been removed.  But when I check through ""More"" and ""Win-Reg"" in the program, all the items are still present.  Then when I try to delete these items, two more come up that were not included in the 82.  When I think I am erasing these items the screen shows the message that a back-up of these files has been made.  Okay, so I then have either erased them or placed them into some back-up file and have rid myself of them.  None is the case: The next time I run the program all 82 are still there.  I must ask: If the program tracks and identifies Invalid Registry Items why is it that I cannot get rid of them?  In the previous version I could get rid of this stuff by going through all these steps.

When I wrote the original Review I gave the program a CLASS 5 vote.  It is still possible that using this program is doing something beneficial.  Is it actually clearing off Temp Files, Junk Files, etc from my hard drive?  I just don't know what it is really doing.  But it is clearly evident that the program is not as good as it should be.

UPDATE 10/15/2012:

I am now running last update - version 12.18.

When I run the One Click program it states that I have over thirty one Megabytes in my Internet Clutter file.  I click on confirm and it is supposed to erase all checked files that it has claimed to find.  I close and reopen the program and it is still there.  Then I click on the MORE and click on Win Clutter, check all boxes, and remove manually.  Same result.  Thirty one Megabytes of clutter is still there.  Next, I reboot my computer and run it again.  This time the same and also Windows Internet Junk File finds over one hundred and thirty Megabytes.  But I just restarted my computer after cleaning everything.  I had not been on the net.

Honestly, something is clearly wrong with this program.  I don't know what it's doing.",original

"I actually really like this product very much.

Yes, it does seem strange to buy an aerosol can of water, but this is pH balanced at 7.0, and has no SD alcohol, witch hazel, fragrance, or other irritating ingredients.

But how is it different from tap water, assuming yours is also at pH 7 level?  It's in the delivery.  This dispenses (for a while) a very fine mist of water continuously.  It dispenses extremely fine water droplets very gently.  I've tried using plastic bottles, but can never get them to dispense so effectively.  It's very nice to use just before applying moisturizer.  I can (well, could) get a very fine layer of water on my skin, which makes it easier to apply moisturizer, and use less as well, offsetting the cost of this product.

I was in love until I got halfway through the can.  I always keep it capped, but the nozzle is clogged.  I've wiped it dry, tried shaking the can, wiped it dry again, but it keeps clogging.  This make it dispense unevenly.  Sometimes just a little water comes out, then it spurts.  This I find very disappointing, because it's difficult to find any product resembling a toner that doesn't have noxious ingredients.",original

"I'm erasing my former review, writing a new one, and changing my rating from 2-STARS to 3-STARS (meaning okay).  I think the program may possibly be doing what it claims so I also purchased usage for a second year.

I gave one of my older computers to a neighbor kid and used Drive Scrubber to remove everything from the hard drive.  I then used the software that came with the old computer to restore it to a like new condition.  I don't actually know if criminal investigators, or information hackers, can restore any of the erased data or not.  But for me, at least in this instance, it doesn't matter.

But understand, I cannot prove that the program actually works.  For sure, its not perfect.  For one thing, when I analyze a disk before erasing deleted data, its result is over-printed on the text and cannot be read.  This is clearly a glitch in the program.  It existed in the first copy I installed, and it exists in the new copy I installed after removing the first - even after downloading the newest version.  This glitch of course, could be caused by my own computer or other software corrupting the program.  I just don't have the computer knowledge to know one way or the other.

Anyway, the program is cheap, uses little computer resources, and may be performing as advertised.  I just cannot know for sure.  You pay your money and you take your chances.",original

"I purchased the ZoneAlarm Internet Suite to replace the expiring Norton Internet Security which was on my computer.  I chose ZoneAlarm due to the high ratings of the firewall by PC Magazine and due to rebates.

I do believe that ZoneAlarm is a very good firewall, but there are issues that I have been having with the software that would cause me to hesitate to purchase it again.  Both ZoneAlarm and Norton have the option to teach the firewall which programs should be allowed to access the internet or to make changes to the registry and which program should be prevented from doing so.  Both programs popup alerts to ask the user for input.  However, Norton has a much more complete list of programs which are threats and which are safe.  For example, ZoneAlarm gave warning for programs such as Internet Explorer, Windows Updater, Adobe PDF and the Restore Wizard.  All of these are programs that are probably on at least 90% of the PCs out there.  Why didn't ZoneAlarm add them to the safe list so that the user would not be bothered?  It seems a simple thing to do to reduce the aggravation of the alerts.

On my PC I have an advertisement blocking software that I have been using for years.  Norton noticed it but once I told Norton that the program was safe, Norton left it alone.  ZoneAlarm gives me alerts about this program each time I startup and shut down windows.  I have told ZoneAlarm that the program is trusted, but I have not been successful in stopping the annoying alerts which require me to click in a window before the computer will finish booting or shutting down.

During the installation, ZoneAlarm did not successfully install my license key and gave me warnings that my updates would expire in 21 days.  I contacted customer support via email (calling them costs a few dollars per minute) and was pleasantly surprised that I received a response within hours, even on the weekend.  I never got such a response from Norton or McAffe.  Kudos to ZoneAlarm for have a very responsive customer support team.

In summary, a very good firewall and good antivirus and antispam product.  However, be prepared for the annoyance of alerts for common programs after you first install ZoneAlarm Internet Suite.  There is a bigger learning curve for ZoneAlarm than for Norton.  But, be comforted by the fact that ZoneAlarm has a responsive customer support team.",original

"I got Norton 360 on a Gold Box special.  I haven't used anything from Symantec in a few years as the last anti-virus program from them caused some serious issues with my computer. I'm afraid this just confirms that Symantec is not to be trusted; ever.

Pros
Installing 360 on my Windows 7 desktop went fairly smoothly; it did force a reboot without warning, but I didn't loose any data.  It offered to add Identity Safe to my browsers and so far, I don't think that has done anything negative.

Cons
360 antivirus hangs more often than not.  When I try to invoke a manual scan on a file or folder, the window starts to open then stops.  I've given it 15 minutes and it doesn't continue.  360 didn't catch a Trojan in a file that I was suspicious of making it less than 100% effective. And now the worst part; 360 instantly deletes any file it doesn't like including system files!  I bought a new Toshiba drive and on plugging it in, 360 deleted the autostart file without warning. Now the backup software that came with the drive won't work.  It's deleted other perfectly innocent files that I've scanned with Microsoft, McAfee and AVG too. It especially doesn't like portable programs.

So to summarize; 360 deletes uninfected files and may still leave you vulnerable to attach.  That makes it worth less than $0 to me.",original

"I've gone through the French 1 DVD disk, and so far you can color me unimpressed.  You are basically only getting 4 disks in an over-sized red cardboard box. For the price paid, I expected this thing to leap tall buildings in a single bound.  They could have at least given me a few jewel cases to store the disks!

There isn't even a ""back"" button I can click to hear things repeated.  You have to go back to the menu every time.  If there is a simpler way, it is not intuitive.

The promised ""pod casts"" or whatever they are called don't work with iphone or blackberry. Huge disappointment! They only mention that in the very fine print on their web page.

The first 10 minutes of the disk is listening to someone drone on and on about how great Fluenz is, and how masterful they are at teaching.  I already bought the package, so why use up my time with more self-indulgent back-patting?

I expected this to be fun, like they said.  If watching someone talk to you with just a plain black background is fun for you, you'll be thrilled.  In this day of CGI, and all the other tremendous tools there are out there for creating instructions, I was pretty disappointed by the lame graphics.  Oh, occasionally they change the background, and put a photo-shopped person in to indicate who you hear talking. They don't move, they just stand there like a cardboard cut-out.

I was hoping to use this as a teaching aid for my middle-school aged kids also, but they were so bored by it I couldn't get them to sit through even one lesson with me.

The software claims it will teach in a totally different way than what you learned in school.  I don't know where they went to school, but what I've seen so far is nearly identical to the way I learned foreign languages in school; learning to listen to conversations first, then going over the meaning, grammar and pronunciation afterward.",original

With Windows 7 you get slight improvements on the task bar and interface - however - you risk losing your data, having to do a complete reinstall of ALL of your programs, and then - when you finally have it installed - many of your programs will crash with Windows 7.

"Microsoft continues to behave in a fascist manner by arrogantly assuming it knows better than the user what their needs are than the users (even experienced users) do.  Then as if to add insult to injury when a deficiency is identified, they steadfastly refuse to address the issue.

Arrogant assumption:
Windows 7 will, unless you hunt down and change a setting, decide to delete icons on your desk top that it deems are broken links on your desk top WITHOUT ASKING.  There are times when you may be working off line or the link to a network connection may be temporarily unavailable.  Windows 7 will simply disappear the desktop icons to these links.  They are NOT in the recycle bin, they are gone for good.  To prevent this you need to disable a system maintenance setting (that Windows 7 strongly advises against doing).

Failed execution:
Windows 7 backup feature does no maintenance of old backup files.  XP would delete the oldest files on your backup drive to make room for new ones (Mac OS does this too).  Not Windows 7.  No sir, the user has to go in and manually delete old files when backups fail due to insufficient disk space.  I have to now go in DAILY and delete backups on my 500 GB storage drive because Microsoft refuses to fix this ""feature"" (they have had complaints about this since Windows 7 was introduced).  Also, back up scheduling is SEVERELY limited over what it was in XP.

So WHY do I continue to use Microsoft products?  My business environment requires it.  Why did I go to Widows 7? Because XP support is going away and Windows 8 is completely business unfriendly.

"UPDATE-----------------------------------------------------------
The Apple issued service packs have essentially eliminated all of the problems with Leopard.  While I am disappointed that there were so many bugs at the time of release, Apple seems to have the worst of it behind them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have been a big Mac fan (not to be confused with the hamburger) for nearly a year. All Apple products have run smooth and installation has been effortless.... and then along comes Leopard. I am very surprised at the number of positive reviews after my recent experiences... my highlights and low-lights after 4 days.

- Internet connectivity - I am ""dropped"" offline on regular occurrences. At first I thought it was our modem/router until I reset both of them only to still be offline. The only thing that worked... restarting my Mac. Maybe it is a coincidence but the this began happening the day I loaded Leopard.

- Memory HOG! I am not sure where it *went* but I now have an additional 20 gigs of hard-drive that is being occupied!

- Not so plug-and-play. I have a Logitech Harmony al-in-one remote ... it works with all previous versions of Mac o/s... but it will not recognize leopard during the set-up. I wonder how many other devices will have this problem?

- Random freezing. Seriously, this is why we dumped our PC! We were looking for a more stable operating system. I wouldn't compare it to the nightmare that is known as Vista... but Windows XP has an edge over Leopard.

- The added features are nice- Time Machine makes backing up a cinch..... but is it worth it? You also get a much clearer picture when you Ichat... too bad the internet connectivity problems reduce our ability to Ichat.

  As a whole....I would like to remove Leopard and wait until a service pack comes out to reinstall it. My recommendation - Hold-off.",original

"I was convinced that I was going to love ""Fresh Frog of Belair"" because I love Kermit and I love OPI. I was sorely disappointed. I had used ""Gone Gonzo"" and apart from its difficulty of removal I did think that it was a pretty color, but even though this is the ""same"" line, the formula is not similar enough to make this a great polish.

Like ""Gone Gonzo,"" ""Fresh Frog of Belair"" is a clear polish with green microglitter and large silver glitter in it. It took SEVEN coats of this polish to cover my nails, and the coverage is still not good. It looks like a cheap drugstore polish and does not cover the edges of my nail or the tips. It looks like I have been digging in gravel and the manicure is brand new. Like other OPI polishes that have this large silver glitter, the ends of my nails were sharp enough to score glass and I had to file them after they were polished. I had to use two coats of Seche Vite topcoat to make the polish smooth enough not to catch on denim, and these NINE layers of polish will take a full thirty minutes to remove, even when using pure acetone.

The color of the microglitter is a bright, leafy green. The glitter is the same color that you can get in the cheap glitter for arts and crafts that you buy at the grocery store. It is not a deep green, has a yellow undertone, and the silver glitter all but disappears and looks like clear spots in the polish. My boyfriend was not impressed.

I don't recommend this color. ""Gone Gonzo"" and ""Gettin' Miss Piggy With It"" would be better options from the Muppets collection. There are far better greens available from OPI.",original

"As compared to Norton Internet Security, OneCare is much easier to get along with. Norton tended to block many programs for no good reason; OneCare does not do that. It is easy to set the programs to block or prompt in OneCare.

But the interface of OneCare is really inferior. The lettering is tiny and faint; not good for anyone with visual problems. But more serious, the program does not tell you what it is doing. If you click for an anti-virus scan,it merely says that a scan is in progress, but the progress is not indicated. You can't tell how long it will take or where it is working.  When it finishes, there is no report, at least if it does not find anything. So you don't know what it actually scanned.

If you press the button in the shortcut menu to scan a particular file or folder, nothing seems to happen. Maybe it is doing a scan, but there is no way of knowing.

There is a ""Tune-up"" feature which, again,only says Tune-up in progress. There is a button to get a report, but the button does not work, and no report actually comes out.

Interestingly enough, the anti-spy, anti-malware feature, a separate program called Windows Defender, has exactly the right interface. When in operation, it clearly shows what it is doing, and then gives a meaningful report when finished.  Why can't OneCare do the same?

OneCare certainly has potential, but its interface needs work.",original

"A little background on me:
I am a long time Quicken user (since the early '90s).  I do both my personal and my wife's business finances on Quicken and though I've never been a big fan of Quicken, but it has always been the best product of its kind that's available in my opinion (that often isn't saying a lot). I run Quicken on a Macbook 13""with 4 gig in Windows XP via Parallels.

I upgraded from Quicken 2008 to 2011 because Quicken notified me that they were no longer supporting 2008 (!).  I have typically never upgraded Quicken unless I was two or more versions behind because most versions were incremental upgrades at best.  I also switched from the ""deluxe"" edition to the ""Home and business"" edition this time around to take advantage of the business reporting features.

On to the review.

Pros:
- The interface is mostly unchanged.  Tweaked a little, yeah, but essentially unchanged.
  -- One step updating, the register, account list, etc. still look much the same and function as they always did. As with any upgrade, finding the features you want can sometimes be a challenge because of some re-organization to the program.

- The interface is fairly easy for a long time user like me to navigate since conventions remain the same.  First time users may have a little learning curve to deal with.

- It is stable and fairly speedy in Windows XP.

- It is still the best of what is available for what I need.

Cons:
- Setting up and editing custom categories is still a pain.  You can't cut & paste or copy & paste when editing categories so EVERYTHING has to be typed in.  I have a large number of subcategories that are very similar to keep track of transactions with a large number of vendors.  With no copy & paste I have to repeat the set up for each one.

- You can't recategorize multiple sub-categories at once.  You have to go into each and every one and make the change individually.

- Documentation is sparse.  if you need help using a specific function, good luck.  The help file isn't very helpful beyond basic (and I mean VERY basic) functionality.  I guess you could call the help line, but my prior experience with Quicken is that they outsourse the help desk to foreign countries, the technicians do not speak English as a first language and they read from a script leading you through the same not so helpful help file you just gave up on.  Things may have changed, but I gave up on them years ago because the experience was so painful.  It was bad enough they just read the help file to me, but their having a poor command of English made it difficult to follow them as well.  I guess Intuit went with the lowest bidder.

- Quicken still loads junkware when loading the program.  This junkware is nothing more than ads for other Intuit products.  Fortunately, all you have to do is send these items to the recycle bin to be rid of them.  Still, it is annoying to have to do this.

Summary:
If you have Quicken 2009 or 2010 I wouldn't bother upgrading unless you have to as I did.  It is still the same old Quicken in a freshened up interface with a couple new bells and whistles.  They have yet to make it truly user friendly, but they do a better job at this than other financial software packages from what I have seen.  For me buying Quicken 2011 was like going to a brand new McDonalds.  Yeah, it is new and shiny and clean, but the menu is still the same.  But then again, sometimes the best surprise is no surprise.

By the way, I purchased this through our local PBS station website so a portion of the purchase amount gets donated to my favorite radio station at no additional cost to me. Thanks Amazon for supporting Public Radio!",original

"Shipping was fast and overall I can say nothing bad about the shipper. The product itself is horrible. The neon color applies streaky and when it dries it almost looks like candle wax, even when applying a glossy top coat.

"Drives me crazy.  It's one thing to quit supporting a product after a few years.  But Quicken, in their effort to make sure we have to buy a new product every few years changes the file formats for transaction downloads.  So if you want to continue to do what you have been doing all along you can't.  They make your existing software and file format obsolete.  Even though it works just fine and serves my purposes perfectly.  The only viable alternative is Microsoft...which is not an alternative at all.

"OK, it does what I bought it for, mostly, eventually.  I got out of the quicken habit many years ago when I didn't upgrade.  My previous experience was that the the software was fine but that intuit was annoying in that they never lost an opportunity to market to me or install unwanted crap on my computer.  Well, my new experience is that they did manage to miss a few annoyance opportunities but have addressed those problems.  I wish they had paid as much attention to shipping a better product.

Seriously, this version is slower than the one I used in 1996 and that was on a computer from that era - about 250 times slower and smaller than my current one.  The new quicken doesn't download account data any better or faster in spite of the broadband versus the old modem connection.  It's still doing the slow agonizing one account after another thing too.  The user interface feels positively sluggish.  Note, this is on a brand new laptop that is otherwise fine.

Having run software organizations, my suspicion is that quicken is a legacy product that no one at Intuit is comfortable programing anymore.  They do their best to adapt to new versions of windows, but that appears to be about all.  Other than that, they bandage what they must to keep this cash cow a-milking.  They probably don't even have a product engineering team in place anymore.  Nothin' there but marketing folks and a product manager pairing up phone support contracts with the cheapest possible suppliers.  They will however, find new and innovative ways to market to us.

Good for them, they have a monopoly and are willing to use it.

Hmmm, this market is starving for a competitive product ...",original

"I LOVE the color of Too Taboo but unlike most of the Essie nail polish colors I have tried so far this color started to chip rather quickly. I put on two coats as it does streak a little when applying the first coat, and also Essie's top coat. Within 2 days I noticed one nail was starting to chip and in 3 days another one. I can usually wear most Essie nail polish colors for at least 7 to 9 days with a base and top coat and I put my hands through a lot. The color pictured is not as pink. It is a deeper pinkish color, not quite a plum though. I would wear it for a special occasion but not for the week. It is fun but not one of my favorites because it chips so easily.",original

"I am a big fan of the PCA line, it has been the only thing to work on my adult acne (mainly the A&c serum, BPO cleanser and nutrient toner). However, I have been using this product for over a month and I do not see any change on the lines under my eyes. I am so used to having fast results with their products that I expected to see some kind of change after the first month. What I can say about this product is that as small as it is I still have A LOT left,PCA products can be expensive but they do last a long time. I will write another review on my third or fourth month.

UPDATE I am a big fan of PCA skin products and I had to update this review because I really believe I was sold an expired toner and other PCA products. I stopped buying PCA products on amazon after comparing them to the ones I bought with my dermatologist or @skinstore.com. I noticed that while everything was the same the expiration dates on the products I bought on amazon where different and where able to come off. Sadly I can't remember the vendor but there must be a reason why they are cheaper here when other sites like dermstore.com or skinstore.com will not even give a small discount on PCA products (PCA products are always excluded from promotions).
The A&C serum I bought came in the old container that had a defective pump if you buy this serum on other skin care sites they have  the newer (better quality) container which is a bit taller and has a better pump.
With that said choose the vendor carefully.",original

"Every time I get a new Quicken program, it is worse than before. Literally. I would go back to the 1990's versions if I could!
I honestly don't understand what those Quicken programmers are up to. I think they just need to tinker with it constantly to justify getting more money for forced upgrades. But they are really downgrades.
There are many features I miss from 15 years ago!
I was forced to ""up"" grade to this version so I could get downloaded quotes and transactions from my broker. That is the ONLY reason I bought this. Intuit is a rip off company. Why no one competes with them is beyond me. They could get a heck of a lot of customers switching from Intuit. Maybe Intuit bumps them off before they can develop anything.

Quicken 2012 ""downgrades"":
1. The ""find"" function in the register no longer automatically chooses the field that the cursor is in, but does ""all fields"" as the default, creating the need for more mouse clicks than before.

2. No longer can do a simple report based on the vendor in the field the cursor is in but have to go to a long menu instead, again necessitating more mouse clicks than before.

3. Got rid of the choice to automatically edit the split of a transaction to the same percentage as the last transaction of that vendor. So now you have to use a calculator to figure it out yourself. More time wasted.

4. Tax report to Turbo Tax closes Quicken

5. Much slower quote downloads. MUCH SLOWER.

Also, there is no W2 report. So why bother letting us track W2's with all the various deductions, taxes, etc? This has never existed that I know of.

I wish Intuit would read this: get a real job! Quit making Quicken worse every year. Stop your monopolizing practices. You used to be a good company when you were small in your basement when you first started. Now you are just greedy jerks.",original

"I've been using BitDefender for the past couple of years.  I found the 2008 version for 3 computers for two years at a great price.  When it was running out, I went looking for a similar deal and found one.

I noticed a couple of unpolished elements when installing.  There were a lot of DOS command prompt windows opening in the background on the screen very briefly.  I didn't have to interact with any of them and they went away almost immediately so there's no harm to it.  It's just a little unpolished.

I should also mention that the update for it is big.  It will ask to download the updated installer, then after a few minutes when that's downloaded and run the updates for the program are currently over 75 MB.  I think that's probably the case with many anti-virus programs, but just be aware if you're on dial-up you'll be downloading for quite some time.

I uninstalled that old&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2008-version/dp/B000V809KW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2008 version</a>&nbsp;from a laptop and a desktop.  The desktop went fine, but the laptop failed to uninstall.  I tried to get the uninstall program off Bitdefender's website, but the link they pointed to was dead.  Eventually, I found the CD and reinstalled, which failed, but the CD had the uninstaller which worked.  I only mention this because it's a little worrisome that if the last program had those issues that this version might when I eventually uninstall it.

I like this version of the program.  It has several different modes ranging from Novice (hides settings) to expert (showing all of it) and is very easy to change between them.  My absolute favorite part though, is the ""you're not fully protected"" system.  In past programs I've used, if you disable some feature you constantly get the little alert icon that you're ""at risk"".  Bitdefender 2010 lets you choose which of those things it monitors for.  So I didn't want the anti-spam because I only use web mail, so I told it not to bother me that I'd deleted it.  It may be a small thing, but to me it's a huge annoyance saver.

So far, I cannot tell if the scanner is faster or not.  It scans at only about a quarter of the number of files per second as the old program, but it supposedly has an intelligent monitoring system which lets it avoid rescanning files that haven't changed and thus couldn't have picked up an infection.  So while it wasn't that fast on the first scan, in theory it'll only get faster moving forward.  It intentionally skipped thousands of files.

Default is a daily scan, which in my opinion is complete overkill.  Unless you have a kid in your house, if the resident protection is running all the time you can get by with once or twice a week.  Thankfully, the scheduling is very easy and you can even set the scans to take low priority, which is a nice touch.

In terms of detection, BitDefender isn't the highest rated scanner, but it's far from the lowest.  It's an excellent budget anti-virus package and more than adequate for most people's needs.  Considering how reasonable the pricing is, I'd happily recommend.  However, since I've only used it a week or so, if it does do anything really weird I'll update my review to mention it.

Update 8/3/10
---------------
Finally had to use my printer and guess what?  BitDefender has killed it.  I can't use my network printer so I'm dropping this review a couple stars.  I killed its firewall and turned the Windows one on again.  Guess what?  I can print again.  I wasted 2 hours dealing trying to fix it before I gave up.  Unacceptable behavior in a firwall.",original

"I have fairly sensitive skin and need a good alcohol free after shave to avoid alot of irritation. I have used several types in the past and this has been the best. It goes on nice and smooth and does not dry out my face. Nothing worse than have that tight and dry skin feeling after shaving. This keeps my face moisturized for quite some time after shaving. Has a pleasant, manly smell too. I will continue to buy this.

Update- I have used this after shave for over a month and I am not really as impressed as I once was. It is not nearly as moisturizing as Proraso after shave, yet it is 3x the price. I will not buy this again because of the price.",original

"You will be sorry.

I downloaded the Windows 8 upgrade Thursday evening into Friday morning.
Yes, the download took several hours on my 3Mbs DSL line. After the download, it took another 3 hours to install the Windows 8 Pro over my Vista Business OS.
After that was done, I was faced with a very foreign user interface. There was no help offered to ease the transition. I finally figured out that the Windows key on my keyboard would present me with a desktop. No Start button, just a bunch of new Apps.
The upgrade did not preserve any of my old apps, so I must reload Office, my scanning software, Adobe Reader and all my other apps.
The new Internet Explorer won't let me use my old email system. Apparently there are some default browser settings that won't let me open the newer att.net mail, so I am using the old version.
What's the deal with Windows mail? I tried registering, but it keeps telling me that I am already registered and must use some existing password that it apparently emails to my new Windows email account that I can't log into.

The resemblance to Widows XP, or Vista is lost to me. This new Wibdows 8 more closely resembles Android, except I find Android easier to use. Maybe because my tablet has a touch screen and a voice command interface. I'm told Windows 8 is designed for a touch screen interface, but my PC does not have that. Actually, now that I think of it, I had fewer troubles adapting to Linux and Unix when I first strarted using them.

I suppose I'll get used to it, but for now, I am using my older PC thst still has XP installed. Even though it is an older PC, I can get a lot more done, more quickly.
I'll turn on my newer PC when I have more time to figure things out. For now, I'll stick with XP.",original

"In all fairness, Intuit has done a good job refining Quicken over the last decade. There is only so many functions you need in a personal finance software. So Intuit is now forcing the users to upgrade by shutting down online feature of the past versions, which I think it's a bad business practice. But I can live with that, if it provides an effortless upgrade. Unfortunately, it doesn't.

Every upgrade is full of problems. The latest episode is upgrading from 2010 to 2013. It won't accept the file password after upgrade. I had to use Quicken password removal tool, by uploading my Quicken file to Intuit server; which has an upload speed of 50kb/sec and download speed is about 30KB/sec. Really Intuit, you can't afford broadband speed?

After an hour of troubleshooting, I was able to open the file with Quicken password removal tool. And all seems to be there...fingers crossed.

***WARNING***
Quicken password removal tool only supports certain versions. A statement from its website:
""The Password Removal Tool will only work with data file passwords used in currently supported versions of Quicken for Windows. So, what that means is it will not work on data files for Quicken for Mac (including Quicken Essentials), older versions of Quicken for Windows (Quicken 2008 and older), nor other passwords associated with Quicken such as transaction passwords and your password vault.""

Make sure you backup your file BEFORE installing 2013, otherwise you might never be able to open your file again.",original

"As of early November 2013, this is not ready for prime time. With a library of around 10,000 songs, it is a very frustrating experience. The app is very slow to respond. Spends too much time obsessing with thumbnails and syncing and refreshing and other things in the background and does not prioritize music playback and user input. Especially when you are in the ""Computer"" tab. If I want to play music that lives on my actual computer, it should be click and play immediately. Not wait for syncing and whatever else the app is doing before it lets you play music.

Part of the problem is that it only has two library viewing options, and they are both graphics heavy. It should have an additional option that is a plain list of albums and songs. You pick an album and play it. You know, a music player! Not a gallery of pretty pictures. The left pane keeps refreshing or doing whatever it is doing, adding to the frustration and unpredictability of the program.

I thought iTunes was slow and bloated, but after using this, *shock*, it gave me a new appreciation of iTunes. It's that bad.

To add insult to injury, the ""download"" option of the web browser version of the Cloud Player now sends you to this desktop app. The desktop app makes the browser version of the Cloud Player look like a work of art. If a browser version of an app outperforms the desktop version, you have a problem.",original

"I've been using TaxCut (now H&R Block at Home) for well over 5 years, and all and all, it's OK.  One year I ran by taxes with BOTH H&R Block and Turbo Tax, and both came up with the same answer.  The issue is not with the program's math, but the way that it asks us to answer the questions, the amount of examples to help us decide what all to include in a number, or if a certain situation applies to us or not.  Again this year, 2009, I waited until the prices came down at least 10 bucks under their usual advertised price.  Generally, you should not file until after Feb 1st as the financial companies have through January to get their forms to you.  And, it's not unusual for the tax preparation companies to have online updates well into February, and if those tweaks applied to you, you'd want them before filing.

Each year, the Federal forms go pretty well, but the State of Wisconsin's forms are lacking in the H&R versions. On several occasions, H&R's program did not handle situations that applied to me, and they tell me, this form is not supported, and here's the link to get the paper form and then I have to file paper, not electronically.  This year, the WI AMT form was not supported.  Sad.  It's not that I really want to pay the AMT tax, but if I have to, at least make it easy for me to do that!  The WI AMT form is a hard one to understand, so this would have really been a good one for H&R Block to have automated.  Maybe next year.

So why do I keep using H&R Block?  They are always 5-10 bucks less, and from what I have seen or heard, the Turbo Tax version is not that much better when it comes to the State forms.  I do like the Deduction Pro add-on that H&R Block provides, so that's a plus.",original

"I only wanted to use Quicken to track my investments.  Ive used Quicken on and off for years and it has become too buggy to use for everything.
The advertisements are also too annoying.  By only using it for investments, I only have to use it once a month.  I have tried other software and unfortunately they are even worse.  So, I'm stuck with Quicken or Excel.  I have too many transactions for excel.

I used it with Fidelity and Etrade.  It has always worked fine with Fidelity.  There has been an issue for years with Etrade.  Dividend reinvesment transactions on ETrade are out to 6 decimal places for number of shares.  The Quicken import only goes out to 3 decimal places.  This always causes an out of balance condition and Quicken tries to make me enter a placeholder transaction to fix the out of balance condition.

I've contacted Quicken many times over this, for no help.  I finally did a download from Etrade in quicken format and looked at the file.  Etrade is actually the problem, only sending the transactions to 3 decimal places.  Obviously, this is a process that was never thoroughly tested by Quicken or Etrade.  I contacted Etrade, who will not admit it's a bug and classified as an enhancement request.  Bottom line, if your using it for investments with Etrade, it will be annoying to use.  If your using it with Fidelity, it works well, including dividend reinvestments, which Fidelity does out to 5 decimal places.",original

"Update 3: 06-04-2010  My xp machine at work was having problems and before I did anything, I UN-installed
PDF coverter pro 5. [as per Nuance instructions]

I ran a repair on windows and everything was running fine again.

I RE-installed pdf converter pro and crap!  When I went to activate, it said I had activated this copy of pdf converter pro 5 the maximum number of times....blah...blah....blah...

Here we go again.

Then it offered me a button to click on to BUY the program?????

I went over to ebay and picked up NITRO PDF 6, on a charity auction for like $40 (w/free S&H)

I tried a few pdf creations and a few pdf conversions with NITRO PDF 6 and so far it looks to work just as good, or better, than nuance's pdf product.

I'll contact Nuance about the problem by fax (can't seem to reach them any other way without PAYING for assistance. If their !#@!$$#@^%  product wasn't such a PITA, no one would have to contact them).

Needless to say, I downgraded this product's rating to a single star.

Update 2: 04-04-2010. Reinstallation of XP operating system CRIPPLED by nuance trying to revalidate license CONSTANTLY during the reinstall of XP.

My XP MCE 2005 operating system lost access to it's HAL.DLL file, requiring a reinstall of the OS.

This PITA pdf converter lost it's ability to validate it's license and CONSTANTLY preempted my
XP reinstall attempts.
Two attempts at removing the pdf converter still did not stop it from trying to validate it's license.
Even used JVPOWERTOOLS 2009, to remove EVERY registry entry for pdf converter AND nuance; still invaded my reinstall of XP.
It got so crippling that I simply used a new hard drive, initialized it and did a clean install of XP; then transferred data/user files afterward.

The validation process they use is a real PITA.

I'd gladly pay (...) or even (...) to just get a USB security dongle , so they can get rid of that
USELESS license verification process, built into their product.

Nuisance (oops, nuance) has NO fallback for those times you must do a clean install on your OS,
(AND are unable to access your OS in order to UNinstall their product ""Prior to"" the OS reinstall).

------------------------------------------
Update 11-01-2009  Be forewarned about activation & loss of product usage.

------------------------------------------
Attention !!!! WARNING !!!!

Nuance does things a lot different with their product's installation & activation.
A couple re-installs of your windows operating system due to windows issues; and/or a couple hardware upgrades like new video card or new hard drive, and PDF converter 5 could cease to function.

My installation had this problem recently.
At almost (...), you expect a program to function 24/7/365.
When mine stopped working, it really interrupted my work production.

So,
If you have this software installed and want to upgrade/changed ANY internal PC hardware, you MUST uninstall the pdf converter pro 5 software
""BEFORE you make ANY hardware changes"" !!!

NOTE: UNinstalling the program in effect ""DE-activates"" your pdf converter pro 5.
Thus ""releaseing"" the license key and this doesn't count against your
""5 license activations"", before product QUITS working!

I work with pc hardware and do pc repairs/upgrades 40+ hours a week.

On my work PC, I have upgraded my mobo 3 times this year. My hard drive twice.
(one of the perks of being the IT helpdesk guy) (last update was to an Intel i7 Core.)

Recently I had lost windows booting abilities, so I installed a newer, larger, hard drive.
So I installed the brand new hard drive and did a clean XP Pro installation.

As soon as I loaded PDF Converter 5 Pro, it wanted to activate.

Then it went online a few seconds and then an error window popped up saying I had exceeded the 5 activation allowances that Nuance allows.

I emailed Nuance the details.
I mentioned how I own 4 retail box copies of this s/w.

After going back and forth with support, they re-activated my license number.

But I could not make PDF files or about 2 days.

*****How to prevent this from happening again?****

If you are using PDF converter 5 on your PC, then ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS
do an UNinstall before changing ANY pc hardware.

The activation process takes serial numbers from the internal components and uses them for activation calculations. (probably the serial # of mobo and/or hard drives).

When a serial number changes due to new hardware, the s/w launches another activation attempt.
Five activations are allowed before the s/w is disabled.

You MUST UNistall the software before doing hardware upgrades, to keep the activation counter from decrementing one of the 5 activation allowances.

This is the sort of thing that should be listed on a neon colored label, on the CD's paper sleeve or jewel case. And/or on the box it comes in.
I told Nuance this, but I doubt they'll do anything about it.

Unforunately, it is not like there are a lot of choices for the
combination software of PDF maker with a PDF converters.

You have:
1. Nuance pdf conveter pro 5
2. Nitro pdf.
3. PDF tools [by solid documents]

Adobe's acrobat pdf maker is pricey and has no conversion abilities. It only creates PDFss.

Other single function s/w conveters are:

Able2extract
Docudesk
PDF conveter elite

Oh, and as far as product functionality, this software does okay.

PDF to word conversions do okay with text; but sort of crappy with images.
(But it seems to be this way with all pdf converter applications).

------------------------------------------------------------
I'm on day 1 of using this software.

Creating a PDF is working fine.

Converting an existing PDF to MS Word is working fine, so far.

Converting an existing PDF with a table inside it; into MS excel is working OK, so far.

Annoyances/problems:

1. After installing software onto my PC, an annoying ""activation"" NAG screen keeps popping up everytime/anytime I launch the program and/or toggle between CREATING a PDF vs CONVERTING a PDF.
Plus it decrements from 30 uses to none.

So off I went to ACTIVATE this whiner!

2. Activation:

a. I just went online, registered,  and then activated it, but apparently it requires further  MANUAL intervention by the enduser (lazy programmers at Nuance).
Because I am still getting the pop-up about not being activated.

b. License key & activation problems:
The setup/installation onto your PC works just fine with numbers and LOWER case letters . [For entering the alpha-numeric license code during installation of the software onto your PC].

But as soon as you get to Nuance's website and try to activate/register,
by using their ""Paste-serial-number-from-clipboard"" button, you get an error!
These boneheads keep kicking back your serial number as INCORRECT until you make it ONLY numbers and only ""UPPER case"" letters.
(why doesn't Nuance spend  a couple bucks on a 5 minute programming ""FIX""  and let the stinking webpage AUTO correct a small issue like these)

Next, trying to correct a serial number which was already ""pasted"" into the Nuance webform box [but contained lower-case letters]. Whenever I'd click my mouse next to a lower case letter and try to CHANGE it to an UPPERcase letter, a wretched pop-up window keeps WHINING about using ""The PASTE button function only"".
For every 1 lower-case letter you try to change to upper-case; you have to answer 2 pop-up windows and make them go away.
[Hey tightwads, fix your website's serial number entry form).
[Go to Elance and hire a programmer for (...) an hour and FIX the problem with ""YOUR"" [NUANCE's] website]

I tried to be  nice  and contact Nuisance (whoops, I mean Nuance) about their problem.
(Starting off an end-user experience like this is NOT going to endear me to rush out and buy any more NUANCE products; especially  if they can't make the registration & activation process easier, functional and more streamlined)

Here's a frustrating experience; Just try contacting these Tight-fisted pukes with a simple FYI, to tell them about a website issue of their's.

These pukes  expect you to shell out (...) per incident  just to contact them.
Sorry dudes, I'm not paying to fix YOUR website problems.

SUMMARY:

Pros - products looks/acts OK so far.
  - cheaper than Adobe

Cons - Just hope you NEVER need to contact NUANCE for ANYTHING.
Or I should say; PLAN to NEVER contact them.
[you can't even throw them a bone about how to improve their website without getting hit up for (...)]
 -poor activation web setup
 - Deceptive/hidden cost details about tech support :
  - no mention on software box
  - no mention inside box, nor in User manual

I bought this program for myself.
Once I test-drove it awhile, I was going to make recommendations to a large client about maybe switching to Nuance (from Adobe).
I really have my doubts now; especially regarding their ""nickel & dime-ing"" attitude toward their end-users.

09-24-2008 update:

I tried converting a bunch of pdf's to word, so i can work with the data within the pdf's.

The program goes fairly fast through the conversion process, until you reach 99%. Then it sits there for what seems like an eternity.

My core-2-duo is not pegged for CPU usage (only 25-50%), but the hard disk light is almost solid.

I found that this program really has a hard time with any text within a book's front cover. Mostly comes out as a mangled mess.
The text pages are decent in the translation.
But plan to run auto-format within Word, to get things cleaned up.",original

"Pros: Works well.

Cons: Purchased Parallels 9 and received an activation code in May 2014. Installed program successfully.
  Mac crashed September 5, 2014 and I lost the program.
  Sept 5 I tried to download Parallels 9 from their website but there was no link to 9. The download only permitted Parallels
  10, at a hefty upgrade price.
  Support/contact/mail numbers were not functional on their website....I was going to ask for a link to the 9 download.

Net: I had the program for 4 months and was forced to pay an upgrade fee to get 10, if I wanted to use Parallels. My original price of $79.95 was revealed by Parallels to be only a 4 month license. I feel cheated, had, taken to the cleaners.",original

"I purchased a few samples of Pureology shampoo+conditioner through the Amazon sampling program, as I was interested in trying Pureology products. I never tried this brand before and wanted to have at least a vague opinion on their products before buying the full size.

The `Hydrate` shampoo and conditioner left my hair thin frizzy hair very smooth and hydrating, but I didn't noticed any major difference from the `Sheer Hydrate` (including the awful smell I absolutely dislike of ylang-ylang and pathouli). For being hydrating, it doesn't make my hair oily too much faster than usual, maybe I get half a day less of `non-oiliness`.

The shampoo did a nice thick lather and cleaned my hair without leaving it squeaky clean (I would need to use it in conjunction with a deep cleaning shampoo once 2-3 washes). I have sensitive scalp with a tendency to get dandruff, with this I didn't get a itchy scalp.
The conditioner wasn't very thick, I was afraid it wouldn't do anything for my hair. But the next day the hair was soft, supple and shinny/luminous (I just loved how healthy it looked); still, it was flat, limp, without any volume.

They were OK shampoo and conditioner, but I will not purchase a full size because I hate the smell of this line. It had a strong herby-minty scent that lingered in my hair until the next wash (although it wasn't that strong)... I'm not a fan of ylang-ylang and the combination with bergamot and patchouli is just awful. Still, for people that enjoy this scent it can be a reason to buy this.",original

"I purchased a new laptop and it came with Vista and 60 day trial of Norton Internet Security 2007.  Because I am a registered user of a previous version of Norton products I received an offer directly from Symantec to buy Norton 360, 3 PC version for less than the Amazon price even with purchase of the download-for-a-year capability.

The good:

- The download and install of the product went smoothly in about 20 minutes.

- The protection is very broad and covers all the typical types of assaults.

- The controls are easy to manage and tweak.

The bad:

- After the download, whenever I go to PayPal the logon is prevented because the browser think's PayPal's security certificate has been revoked.  Both PayPal and Symantec blame Microsoft, but it worked okay before 360 and it works fine on the Vista desktop I have protected by Live OneCare.  The workaround is temporarily suspend anti-phishing protection, which 360 makes easy.

- 2 days after purchasing the software I went online to load Norton 360 on my second desktop.  The site rejected my order number as invalid.  When I logged in to the Symantec site, it shows I have an active license but doesn't show I have any orders.  After 4 attempts I finally got a response from the Symantec email support team.  It was obvious they hadn't read the details of my problem, only the header.  They gave me the link to put in my order number to download, but of course that is the problem.  The note also warns I shouldn't contact them about the same problem again for 7 days.  I guess I could use my dime and queue up for who knows how long on their phone response support, but that doesn't seem cost effective for less than $50, especially when the result may be the same.  I have contacted the email support team again, no response at this point.  So I am less than a week into a 3 computer license with a year of download protection with only one copy working and no way to get the other copies.  If they do not respond by the time my credit card statement comes I am cancelling the software payment and will unload the software.

I have happily used Symantec products in the past but was never reduced to using their download service or online support.  It appears ignorance is bliss as my experience with the service and support is that they are extremely poor.  So if you do want to try this product I strongly suggest staying away from Symantec's online store and get the CD.  This should reduce the probability of problems and needing to interact with Symantec itself.",original

"I used Quicken for at least 10 years, going back to around 1990.  I stopped using Quicken about 8 or 9 years ago, due to all the bugs.

Well, I needed something to track my investments.  I needed to know, if overall I was making a decent return.  I don't want it for banking, etc.  I tried Acemoney and Moneydance.  Both of those were unable to download a ""starting"" balance from my brokerage accounts.  So, I reluctantly went back to Quicken.

By default, Quicken sends your data to it's website.  Turned that off!

I have brokerage accounts with Fidelity and ETrade.  So, far it works ok with Fidelity.  I have my accounts set up for dividend reinvestments.  ETrade goes out to 6 decimal places.  Quicken goes out to 6 decimal places for balances, but only 3 for transactions.  What?!  So, every dividend re-investment ends up out of balance and it makes you put in a place holder transaction for those fractions.  Updating the original and deleting the placeholder is a big pain.

This was a bug 8 or 9 years ago.  Obviously they did not do a good job of testing this software.

If you have ETrade, I would recommend staying away from this product.",original

I was then connected to a support supervisor who uninstalled and reinstalled at least four times.  Then he started to mess with the registry files.  He decided that N360 didn't removed the previous version of NIS properly.  On the next uninstall-reinstall cycle same error message.  After 1:10 with me, he then proclaimed it must be a W7 problem, eventhough NIS was working fine yesterday and haven't had any issues with W7.  He is now reinstalling W7 and will call me back in an hour.  What a joke!  I had hoped Symantec got its act together.  Looks like I am wrong!",original
"** UPDATED**
After about two decades of using Quicken and regularly upgrading, I am kicking Intuit to the curb. I upgrade when I want. Period. The last time was June 2012 for Quicken. There has been nothing in newer versions to make it worthwhile to pay for an upgrade. Intuit / Quicken doesn't like that and tried to strong arm me into purchasing version 2015. Unless it's free, I don't want version 2015. It has nothing for me, but I received notice today that if I don't open my wallet and give them $20, they will take away features from my 2012 version. I have to upgrade or lose the ability to download transactions. In order to continue using that feature, I have to buy it again? Business must be bad to resort to bullying. I'm jumping from Intuit's sinking ship and looking at other options. If I find nothing, I'll rather use a spreadsheet than go back to Quicken. I know that if you give a bully your lunch money today, he'll try to force you again tomorrow and every following day. Nope, I'm standing up now and saying: Hey Intuit / Quicken, get the * out of here and go pick on someone your own size!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
About 15 years ago a friend recommended Quicken to help me manage my finances. I haven't been one to jump on the new releases. Quicken Deluxe 2012 is my 3rd upgrade and I am once again not disappointed.

My finances are nothing spectacular. I have a checking and savings accounts with two brick and mortar banks, plus another of each with ING Direct. There are loan accounts for my house and one car. 9 credit cards and 3 brokerage accounts complete my financial picture.

While the capability has been available in previous versions, this is the first time I've used the automatic update feature. I love not having to sign in to each institution's website to get transaction info to enter. Quicken pulls the info for me and presents it in an manner that allows me to accept or edit each individual transaction.

The calendar is one feature I've used and relied on for many years. I credit it for having helped me not miss even one payment in over a decade.

I can't help you compare Quicken to any other finance software, because Quicken is all I've ever used. That said, I can't think of one thing or function that I would like that Quicken doesn't provide.

The one thing that irks me is how dramatically the price has gone up since my last version. 2012 cost me more than double what I paid in 2006. With the exception of the price of the software, I am 100% satisfied.",original

"I know, giving a product one star because it fails at one feature that not every user needs may seem unfair.  But everyone knows Amazon's rating system is utterly subjective -- and for me, this one failing on the part of Quicken Deluxe 2011 is extremely annoying and devastating.

I had been using Money 2006 for several years.  As everyone knows, that product line was discontinued due to lack of demand.  I decided to get Quicken Deluxe 2011, which promised Money file compatibility.  While waiting for Quicken to arrive from Amazon, I uninstalled Money 2006 to reclaim some disk space.

To my great distress, I discovered, upon launching Quicken, that Money must be present on the system for Quicken to import the Money file!  According to the dialog box, ""Microsoft Money 2007 or 2008 must be installed on your computer before we can import your Money file.""  Okay, so maybe Money 2006 wouldn't even have worked, so it probably wouldn't have made a difference in my case.  But this is just absolutely ridiculous.  My Money file has no password protection, and I just don't see why Money is required to be installed for Quicken to read the file.

So I decided to give Quicken a spin anyway to see if it was worth my time to start from scratch.  When I clicked on that big ""Get Started"" button, Quicken started downloading an updated financial institution list.  After 10 minutes, it was still doing the same (the status indicator was simply moronic and indicated little).  I stopped out of that, and clicked ""Get Started"" again, this time Quicken began downloading a program update, but then nothing happened.  At this point, I decided to write up this review.

One other thing I also noticed is, after I ran Quicken for the first time, my quad-core PC, which had always been zippy and extremely responsive in everything, has begun to show some random slowdowns, which reminded me of the days when I ran Symantec's awful Norton Anti-Virus software.  I really wonder if Intuit installed some background services that have a significantly negative impact on my otherwise optimized system (Win 7 64-bit).

As you can see, my getting-started experience with Quicken Deluxe 2011 has been entirely negative.  I regret having wasted almost 40 bucks on a competely useless program.",original

"Windows 8 takes more clicks to get around than Windows 7. It would be great if you install it on a touch screen laptop. I don't necessarily think it's a tablet friendly OS.

I do think the changes that are in the new OS are necessary due to moving to move touch interface on all mobile devices however, until more are available I think people are going to find clicking more to get to a given application will be irritating.

The biggest complaint is that it IE 10 doesn't work with some websites. The sites display correctly and ever look better the problem is that check boxes on the sites don't work.",original

This razor head is massive! I deducted one star given the massive size of the razors head which makes it hard to see around and hard to shave under your nose. I also deducted one star given the razor has no knurling on the handle which makes it very slick to hold onto. Which is not a good thing given the weight of this razor. The razor does give good verbal feedback as you can hear the razor taking the whiskers off as it slices thru them. On a three day growth I did the first pass on a # 3 setting. And for the second pass I readjusted down to a #1. It did produce a close shave which it should given it is a razor. The whiskers rinse very easy and cleanly from the head as you shave. I would say on its highest setting there is no growth that it would not remove! And with no problem at all short of a full beard!,original

"I've gone through the French 1 DVD disk, and so far you can color me unimpressed.  You are basically only getting 4 disks in an over-sized red cardboard box. For the price paid, I expected this thing to leap tall buildings in a single bound.  They could have at least given me a few jewel cases to store the disks!

There isn't even a ""back"" button I can click to hear things repeated.  You have to go back to the menu every time.  If there is a simpler way, it is not intuitive.

The promised ""pod casts"" or whatever they are called don't work with iphone or blackberry. Huge disappointment! They only mention that in the very fine print on their web page.

The first 10 minutes of the disk is listening to someone drone on and on about how great Fluenz is, and how masterful they are at teaching.  I already bought the package, so why use up my time with more self-indulgent back-patting?

I expected this to be fun, like they said.  If watching someone talk to you with just a plain black background is fun for you, you'll be thrilled.  In this day of CGI, and all the other tremendous tools there are out there for creating instructions, I was pretty disappointed by the lame graphics.  Oh, occasionally they change the background, and put a photo-shopped person in to indicate who you hear talking. They don't move, they just stand there like a cardboard cut-out.

I was hoping to use this as a teaching aid for my middle-school aged kids also, but they were so bored by it I couldn't get them to sit through even one lesson with me.

The software claims it will teach in a totally different way than what you learned in school.  I don't know where they went to school, but what I've seen so far is nearly identical to the way I learned foreign languages in school; learning to listen to conversations first, then going over the meaning, grammar and pronunciation afterward.",original

"To begin with ...

I'm neither a Quicken-hater nor a raving fan.  I use it because it helps me manage my financial life, and I haven't found anything better ... yet.  It mostly works.

This is a review based on first impressions after a recent upgrade; I will update if I have further information to share.

Review begins here ...

As the world knows, Quicken hasn't really improved much over the last 5 years or so -- they just go through with UI changes and minor tweaks.  And the changes usually fall equally between ""annoying, why did they change that?"" and ""ok, maybe that's a slight improvement"".

I just upgraded from Q2007, and only because of the ""current + 2 previous"" support policy.  (No, I don't have a big problem with this policy.)

The upgrade was painless, and the file conversions worked without problems.  (I use two separate files for different purposes.)

I find the UI changes mostly unimportant ... and I'm talking about 3 years worth of changes, folks!  I haven't found any significant functional improvements either.  They haven't even bothered improving the login process for financial institutions (like my bank) which are using what I'll call multi-step login (user id, password, and personal question selected from a list).

One annoying change is the ""Community"" logo on the top right -- yeah, I really wanted that one, it'll improve my life dramatically.  This could easily have been an icon on the toolbar, so that those who want it keep it, those who don't can remove it.

Ok, so far it's all break-even, assuming that you accept the idea of buying the software more like a subscription than a one-time purchase.  The big negative so far is that the app is much slower now: apparently there's a lot more on-the-fly calculation going on now when you switch screens or change data.

Recommendation: If you use Quicken, and want to continue doing so, don't be afraid of this upgrade.  Don't rush to it, either.",original

1st problem was that the 2nd, bonus CD's serial number was coming up as invalid.

2nd problem: Unable to capture any video.

I have 4 different video capture devices:
1. pinnacle (bought in 2008)
2. Dazzle 100 series (bought in 2008)
3. Dazzle 150b
4. ADS tech X2 (bought in 2007)

Despite trying with all 4 devices, I keep getting the error,""Cannot start Capture graph"".

Amazingly the corel website does NOT even list this error in the search results!?
Yet when googling for it, you'll find this user problem on probably a 100 + webpages.

(I guess if corel denies the problem exists, then they don't have to address/fix it)

This is the first FULL video editor package I have bought in years.
Each of the 4 RCA to USB video capture devices came with either an
SE ""special edition"" or LE ""Light edition"" of either pinnacle studio or Ulead videostudio.
All the stripped down programs actually WORK.
The full version of Videostudio 11.5 does NOT!!!

After numerous update attempts, repair attempts, remove & re-install attempts, I gave up.
I never had a ulead[corel] program be so messed up.

I had a copy of videostudio plus X2 on order (it came up on amazon on sale for $39.99 last weekend).
Today I saw that it had not be shipped, so I cancelled the X2 version.

The lack of knowledge base support for an application with serious issues, is criminal.  For crying out loud, just fix it with a patch and list the fix in the corel knowledgebase.
To omit it from the corel website is the sign of a real craptastic company.
I always liked ulead products until this one.

A huge disappointment.",original

"I have installed the Win Cleaner program on both XP and Vista.  When I tried to update them I was informed that I had used up my updates and that I should purchase another update.  Also, I was advised that if this was not actually true I could file for a ""ticket"" to fix the problem.  I went to the ""WinCleaner"" website, left a message, and wrote down the Ticket Number they assigned.

Then I did the One Click thing on the original program. It did improve the boot time.  So, without the update, I reduced boot time from five minutes to four minutes.  This is some improvement. Wow, 20% faster boot  time.  But it still would not update.  I used email aqain to voice my complaint.

The next day I received an email from ""WinCleaner"" with a hyperlink to download a new program.  I did this and rebooted my machine.  Then I ran the One Click program again.  Then, after installing the download on my three computers, it seemed to run as advertised.

###-UPDATE-###

10/22/10

Okay, so I finally got the kinks worked out in July of 2009. But I was not quite satisfied.  I decided to install ""DriveScrubber 3.""  It removed much more  after running ""WinCleaner.""  Using the two programs together I felt reasonably well covered.

Then I made the mistake of running the program past the expiration date.  Rather than simply being cut off from further use until I renewed, it failed to notify me and instead destroyed my Registry.  Of course, ""WinCleaner"" no longer runs properly.  Now, each time I boot up my computer, I have to stop several programs that are all trying to run at the same time.  Of course, I could maybe fix this problem by simply buying another year of ""WinClearner"" use.  But I think I'll download that free program ""Windows Registry Repair"" before I decide.  With ""DriveScrubber 3"" and the free ""Windows Registry Repair,"" I should be well enough covered.  Maybe I can get off this treadmill.  All this is sure a lot of time consuming trouble!",original

"The 2014 version started out with quite a few bugs in it.  Now that they've finished the patching, I think there is still a little bugginess left.  I understand that the 2015 version is also buggy so I'll probably just continue to suffer along with this version for another year or two.  I have to stay with Quicken because I have 25 years of complete financial history on it and wouldn't want to lose that.  I currently track 32 active accounts varying from property to investments to simple savings, checking, and cash accounts on it.  I got my first exposure to Quicken when I purchased a different software product and the store gave me Quicken for free... it was a promotion at the time. That giveaway paid dividends to Intuit as I've purchased many versions since.

Quicken is a very good way to keep track of all your finances in one place.  One word of caution: Make frequent backups of your Quicken file.  They will, on occasion, become corrupt.",original
"Let me start by saying that I am in no way a Microsoft or Windows basher.  I have installed and used Windows from version 2.4 (yes, there was such a thing) through 3.0,3.1,95,98,ME,NT,2000,XP, and Vista.  I've also built several desktops and would be considered proficient with computers.  I also run Windows 7 64 bit on my new laptop (it came preloaded) and loved it so much that I decided to buy the upgrade for my older desktop.  That's where the story takes a sad turn.  In short, this review is about my experience with the UPGRADE version that I paid for and not Windows 7 it self.  If you can install it, it's pretty great.

I got this because I wanted to take advantage of the 64 bit capabilities of Windows 7.  The computer in question is older, but still more than capable - Dual Core 6400 with intel DG-965RY motherboard, 6 gigs of ram, 2 320 gig hard drives and a Nvidia 7900 GS card.  Originally it was running XP 32 and later upgraded to Vista ultimate 32.

The first problem I ran into was that because this is the upgrade version, it requires a valid previous installation of vista or XP.  What I usually like to do is wipe everything off my old drive before installing the new OS but this requirement prevented me to do so.  I don't see the point of checking the OS.  Yes, I know this is the upgrade but it could just as easily ask me to put in the VISTA or XP dvd to check to see if I have it.

Next, the installation was painfully slow.  I started the installation in the afternoon and by the next morning it was only at 74% done.  later in that afternoon (after around 20 hours) it booted up for the last time and indicated Windows 7 was about to start.  I thoguht the nightmare was over but it was just starting.  After asking me to choose a name and password (very sluggishly) I was asked to type in the product key which i did.  Then the system froze and appeared to be doing something.  so again i went to bed and woke up the next day only to see my computer had gone into standby mode.

For the next 7 hours I waited for it to finish installing (turning the mouse to make sure it wouldn't go into standby mode again) but it never did.  I restarted the computer and went through the last step again but again it froze.  This time I decided to install XP again (which installed in about 25 minutes) and wipe everything off the hard drive, disable my USB ports, etc. and went through that again.

Long story short, after 5 days, the upgrade freezes right after I put in my product key.  I have not tried the 32 bit version yet but the whole point of getting this was to use the 64 bit and extra RAM.  It's very obvious Microsoft did not test this enough for upgrades.  Even by their own admission, their own people took around 20 hours for upgrades so that should have been a red flag.

So my recommendation is don't bother upgrading if you already have a system that's working.  Either put it in a brand new system that's windows 7 certified or buy a computer with it built in.  I'm out a $100 but you shouldn't have to be.

*update*
I called MS tech support and was surprised at how eager they were to help.  I got several call backs to check on the status of the install, but unfortunately my machine just isn't made for windows 7 despite intel having windows 7 drivers for it.  I added another star for tech support's efforts.

*final update*
Overall I should take some of the blame too because when I ran the upgrade advisor, it told me that I was good to go (minus my linksys USB adapter) for the 32 bit version and I falsely assumed that it would be true for the 64 bit version as well.  Before installing, I tried to run the 64 bit upgrade advisor off the DVD but the actual program wouldn't run on a 32 bit platform which I found kind of odd.  For me the whole point of the upgrade was to go 64 bit and take advantage of my CPU and access to extra RAM so I am back on Vista (which runs great btw).  So take my review with a grain of salt.",original

"I've been using Quicken to manage my finances for about 20 years.  Quicken is a great aide and worth the time it takes to input income and expenses.  I upgrade almost every year.  The 2013 version, even though they've had updates to it since it was released, seems quite buggy.  If you're a Quicken user I suggest skipping the upgrade this year and waiting for the 2014 version to come out before upgrading.

Aside from the bugginess, one thing that irked me is that my hidden accounts, accounts no longer used came back to the forefront after my data file was changed for this version.  I had to figure out how to go in and officially close those accounts.  Two of the accounts wouldn't close, probably because even though they were zero'd out, Quicken still shows them each with a balance of .01 cent even though if I look at the account itself it shows zero there.  Buggy, buggy, buggy.  Wait until next year.",original

"I have six computers and all of them run Kaspersky in one version or another. I put Kaspersky Pure 2011 on my computer last year. I don't use it to manage the other computers and so I figured it was a waste of computer resources and decided to take advantage of a sale on Kaspersky Internet Security (KIS) 2012. I've installed and used the KIS before on all my six computers and others. In the past, I was able to install a newer version of Kaspersky without uninstalling the older version. Last Spring when I installed KIS 2011 on my daughter's computer, I had a problem and had to uninstall the previous version of Kaspersky. No problem. When I tried to install KIS 2012 on my computer last week, I also encountered the uninstall request, so I tried to uninstall Kaspersky Pure to no avail. It kept hanging up after going through most of the uninstall and my computer froze and had to be rebooted. This occurred three, separate attempts and my computer froze at the exact same point each time. Well, I needed AV software particularly since I was beginning my last online graduate class on cybersecurity. So, I had no choice but to order Kaspersky Pure 2. I could not call Kaspersky only email them. When they got back to me, I had already installed Kaspersky Pure 2. This installed without a problem and no hanging up or rebooting was needed. So, Kaspersky's response was a form letter kind of response about incompatible software, firewalls, uninstalling other versions of AV software etc. I emailed them once again. Really, they should look into this because I do not want to have to install Pure next year! I have not yet heard back from them. I will say that when one of my daughter's accidentally downloaded malware to one of our computers, Kaspersky was spot on and responded in a timely fashion and provided steps on removing it and sending them the evidence. So, either they have changed since last year, or they don't care about this problem.
The two stars are about the issue of not being able to uninstall Kaspersky Pure - ridiculous. I have a Windows 7 64-bit Dell core i7 laptop with two solid state hard drives and an undercarriage cooling system. Other than this issue, the Pure 2 has worked well except that I apparently encountered TWO (count 'em) Trojans on a very reputable website (doing research paper work) and rather than quarantine them, Kaspersky Pure 2 presented a message stating that they could not be quarantined, that I must delete the archive or do nothing. I don't know what archive it was referencing but without any other options, I did what I was told and had to do this twice - I guess one for each Trojan. With other malware in the past, Kaspersky has always quarantined it. I am unsure what to make of this but haven't had time to research it.",original

"I have used a version of QuickBooks for a little over 10 years now.  With this upgrade, I don't see many new benefits for how i use the program - small LLC, no employees except me, and minimal inventory and PO requirements - and I am extremely annoyed with being ""forced"" to upgrade to the new version.  If I am going to be required to upgrade, I would really prefer some new bells and whistles that makes me think I got something for my money vs. basically a software licensing fee.

My install on a Windows 7 machine took a little time, but it was pain-free and not like my Vista nightmare install of a few years ago.  The backup file integrated smoothly.

I do wish there was a way (maybe there is, but I can't seem to find it) to turn off the annoying ads that appear everywhere.  I have told the software numerous times I don't want their payroll or online storage options, and I don't want to order blank check stock from them yet the ads appear.

"Good brand but the main thing I didn't like about this is the long-lastingness or thickness of it. It has an ok smell and dries nicely but 24 hours later you can still taste it around your lips- gross! Get the Proraso pre/post shave cream and it has a better smell and gives your skin a smooth tightness and it heals nicks better.

SHAVING- let me save you years of trial and error: take a warm shower & wash your face with billy jealousy exfoliating facial cleanser, shave afterwards with a $50 Merkur safety razor handle with good blades (save $100's on mach 3 refills!), use a $20 Tweezerman badger hair shaving brush to apply taylor of old street bond (or proraso) shaving cream (you can let it set in a minute), shave WITH the grain DOWN, SLOWLY, SOFTLY (don't press hard- let the weight of the handle and sharp blade do the cutting), lastly rub on a fingertip of proraso pre/post shave cream while your face is still wet and let it dry! Say goodbye to razor bumps and ingrown hairs FOREVER! Trust me- I've tried dozens of pricey face washes, shaving creams, and after shaves over the last 4 years. If you don't want to commit so much money yet- order the pre/post shave proraso cream online, buy proraso shave cream online or at bath and body works (under their C.O. Bigelow label) then get the cheap single blade disposables (mach 3's are too aggressive) at a grocery store and you'll notice a difference overnight.",original

"Microsoft Windows 8.1 is very different from the previous versions of MS Windows. MS Windows 8 and 8.1 tries to be two things in one package, an operating system for both desktop computers and tablet computers. There is a bit of a learning curve for finding all of the functions of the computer. This version also requires that you log in with Microsoft Account. It is used for saving all of your settings and passwords as well as buy and downloading Apps in the Windows Store. Other than having a quicker boot up time and having the Start Screen, MS Windows 8.1 seems to be a lot like MS Windows 7.

As a Mac user and a long time MS Windows user, I still have to look for things when I want to change a setting or something. There seem to be settings in the Control Panel for the Desktop mode and most of classic windows settings. There is also another pane of the Start Screen for settings that have to deal with the Tiles and the Start Screen. It seemed kind of odd, that I had to go into the desktop mode to set up my printer and that there is only current apps that then could access the printer in the Tile mode. Also I think what is odd, is that Internet Explorer in the Tile mode does not carry over all the settings that I have set for Internet Explorer in the desktop mode. I think this is kind of crazy. This is just one of the may interesting aspects of the new version of MS Windows.
MS Windows 8.1 is a vision of having one inter face for both traditional computers as well as new touch computing devices. I would only recommend this for people who are true MS Windows fan boys or someone who thinks they will really like the new Start Screen interface. Otherwise I think it might be kind of confusing for some people. I would say that it was a good try on Microsofts part but it seems a little too awkward unless its being used on a touchscreen.

If things were more organized and easier to find, I could give this a higher rating than three stars. MS Windows 7 seem to make was a good operating system and seemed to be more organized. I would say that this is better than MS Windows Vista. I think this is a good upgrade of you want the new Start Screen interface other wise you are not missing much with MS Windows 7.

My use of MS Windows 8.1 has been just on traditional desktop computer without a touchscreen interface (HP Pavilion Slimline s5-1120 Desktop PC).",original

"I am a 20 year user of Quicken.  Generally I have been satisfied with it until this year.  I am a Mac owner and have installed Parallels and Windows just so I could run Quicken.

I even was a beta tester for their Mac product.  I was disturbed when as a tester that Quicken ignored the majority of the other beta testers who were asking them to basically port the Windows version and features to the Mac version.

Now with 2013 they have decided to eliminate a simple way they had been using to enter, track and pay loans.  Instead they have created an obscure, complicated, not user friendly process (Not a simple window with your needed options like ""pay"" and ""when"" and ""make extra payment"" and check balances.)

Other users have complained about this and several have said they will drop the program after many years if Quicken does not change it to the simple process it was before.

I will wait a month and if it is not fixed, I will look for a better finance program.",original

"Like you, I don't have time to write reviews -- but this product is such a disappointment I feel I must. I've used PC's for decades. Norton was once the only reliable protection -- back in the DOS days. I dropped Norton 5 years ago because it'd become a resource hog -- and went to PC-Cillin -- but it grew slower, so after 2 years I tried Norton again -- finding it still a resource hog. After 1 year, I switched to Bitdefender -- and found it much faster, but it slowed email too much --even with email scanning turned off. When the subscription ran out, I read reviews saying the ""new"" Norton was now the most efficient, with competitive protection -- and chose it for the coming year -- just 6 weeks ago. It's turned out to be unuseable -- unpredictable slow-downs (even in ""Silent Mode"") with system lock-ups (no blue screens, but same effect). I can't wait a year this time. I'll just have to write-off the expense and find another. Truth is, I've no way to vet the reviewers -- too many are ""planted"" by the manufacturers -- or seduced by their advertising money. IT MAY WORK FINE on many machines, BUT Norton 360v3 is the worst I've encountered -- so bad I can't wait until next year to find one that serves me.",original

"Just to let my fellow Alienheads know: As of the time of this review, AlienFX DOES NOT work with W8 and there is no patch or fix.  Who knows, may be the AlienFX for W8 is in the works, but as of right now you will be stuck with an all-red theme and there is no way to even turn it off.

I've been using the demo for about last month or so on my other computer, thinking that the final product would be different and polished, but it is not.  As I installed it, I realized that it's pretty much the same thing.  It did prompt me for 15 updates, so looks like if you are getting this now, get ready for a lot of these off the bat.  For some reason, I keep getting UAC popups pretty much for every action that I do.  I had to turn the UAC notifications off, but now I don't feel safe.  The whole installation took about half an hour(I picked the option to move as much of my old stuff as possible.)

Windows 8 seems to be a good choice for tablets, because who would want to get up from their chairs to swipe their monitors?  Yes, you can go to your old desktop by pressing the WINDOWS key, but you will feel a bit lost without your trust old friend ""The Start Button.""  Of course you can still use your mouse to navigate, but a lot of actions require you to go to the edge of the screen and it could be tough to ""catch"" it.

Not everything about W8 I found is bad.  The Metro Interface is an eye-pleaser and with (hopefully) more apps on the way, I'll use it more in the future.  For now, Skype looks pretty good as an app.  System does boot faster and feels faster.

That's about it for Day 1 of official version plus some time using the demo.  Desktop users:  I would recommend waiting until the system is updated and more patches are released.  Tablet/laptop users with touch-screens: This system is definitely ready for you.  Hopefully with time, W8 could be fully enjoyed by desktops users as well or else this could be the new Windows ME.",original

"Microsoft started life as the up and coming company that dared take on IBM and won the personal micro-computing industry as its prize.  Apple existed but its computers never caught the market share enjoyed by Microsoft and its Windows family of products.  Next came the Microsoft Office Suite with its Outlook, Excel, Word and Access heavy hitters.  For a time in the computer world it looked as if Microsoft was an unstoppable Juggernaut.  But all those years of success had changed Microsoft from its former nimble self that anticipated what the market needed and was there at the ready with new innovative products before the customer even knew they wanted \ needed fresh technology.  Microsoft over time became what it once mocked, laughed at and despised in the corporate giants of mainframe computing.  Microsoft has become steeped in the same muddled self defeating institutional thinking that prevented Xerox and IBM from cashing in big time on many of the monumental computing innovations they spawned.

The Apple IPad and IPod and other products caught Microsoft napping and today Apple is bigger than Microsoft.  This brings us to Windows 8 part of Microsoft's best answer to a fast changing computing universe.  Microsoft missed the boat on pad, pod hand held and tablet computing revolution.  Microsoft still rules in the desktop computing arena but, Microsoft's desktop computer sales market share is being steadily eroded by the pads, pods, tablets and other hand held smart devices.  Windows 8 is Microsoft's software based version of a Hail Mary pass made in the computer marketplace.  Windows 8 is built around a touch screen type interface at least on the surface no pun intended. The Windows 8 touch screen interface is meant to suggest Microsoft is developing software in tune with todays Ipad, Ipod, Smart Device and tablet centric times. To win back users lost to smart phones and smart device touch screens Microsoft dumped its tried and true if dated Desktop, with its icons, mice, point \ click, task bar and Start button technology.  Windows 8 is a heavily touch screen based graphical interface that brings smart phone \ ipad like functionality to the desktop computing arena.  Mouse use is still accommodated in Windows 8 but you can see by its clumsy integration into the Windows 8 operating system that mice are tolerated like a irrelevant old auntie who has totally over stayed her welcome.  Unfortunately like many new innovations the devil is in the details of how Windows 8 was changed.  Ask yourself the questions in the next paragraph to see is Windows 8 right for you.

Is the touch screen format the very best way of interacting with your desktop interface.  Any hand held smart device benefits from a touch screen interface because; the entire device is in your hand.  A desk top monitor by compassion is huge.  Also the monitor as an output device is oriented vertical to the user which works as a display only output device but as an input device the vertical monitor is ineffective awkward and and clumsy to use.  Looking down at the interface allows easy touch screen use.  As an example imagine playing the piano if you had to reach forward to touch each of its 88 keys instead of looking down at the ""Keyboard!""  I'd dare say piano music would have a different history were this the case. You have to reach forward to interact using touch with most desktop systems.  You look down onto hand held devices which make them easier and comfortable to use. Also work in offices conforms to a different production and management paradigm compared to tasks common to smart phone and smart device touch phone user tasks.  You can't just graph a touch screen onto a desktop system and proclaim it an monumental innovation which a lesson Microsoft is in the process of learning with Windows 8.  Windows 8 is a very pretty but ill conceived interface that succeeds at being new but fails at being better, more user friendly or easy to acclimate to when moving from Windows Vista, Windows 7 or any Windows 95 themed desktop operating system interface.  Windows 8 is pretty and if you are a tried and true computer geek like me you will buy Windows 8 simply because it is there standing as a challenge to be overcome and mastered.  However does Windows 8 offer the traditional Windows 7, XP or Windows Vista desktop operating system user any advantages over a stable awesome Windows 7 is the question you must ask yourself.

If you dig under that pretty new touch screen you will find much of the same programs, utilities and goodies you have in Windows 7.  The problem with Windows 8 is not the operating system it is the many changes in how you navigate the Windows 8 computer environment.  Windows 8 is like coming home to find your whole house rearranged to the point where nothing is where you are used to finding it.  Things are placed in odd new places to accommodate the touch screen technology at the expense of point and click mouse users.  At first it appears nothing in Windows 8 is as easy to use and manage as it once was in Windows 7.  Windows 8 is change for change sake that appears forced, hurried and not at all well thought out.  Windows 8 embraces change to touch screen technology not because it was the next logical evolution in desktop operating system design and ease of use.  Windows 8 appears to be built simply to let Microsoft say me too in a world of touch screen driven smart devices that is rapidly moving away and redefining desktop computing.  In Windows 8 Microsoft is following change rather than leading it and it shows glaringly in this product.  Microsoft is a Johnny come lately to the touch screen smart device world and is being forced by the computing marketplace to do a Hail Mary Play.  Microsoft is hoping like any Hail Mary Play that Windows 8 will propel it back into its glory days where Microsoft was an engine of computing innovation envied by the world.  Windows 8 is a good solid operating system if you have the time and will to relearn almost everything you do on a desktop computer.  Otherwise Microsoft Windows 8 is a Hail Mary Pass created for the same reason Mary Mary Passes are used in football.  Microsoft could have lots of good ideas yet to come but I do not think Windows 8 is one of those better ideas.  Windows 8 is an Operating System change in order to say me too in a world computing device marketplace nothing more.

It is nearly impossible to get to help on their web site,

Their pricing seems very deceptive.  You never know how much you are going to pay.  Every time you turn a corner there is a new place to charge you.  Let's be honest and UPFRONT about pricing.

Bottom line, if you have basic taxes, you will probably be ok, but if things get difficult, your experience will get very difficult and quite possibly your results will be wrong.",original

"If you can figure out how to make it work; clue--you can back up your files just as easily by copying them to an external HD and it's 10 x less hassle to copy them back when you format.

If all you want is to schedule file back-ups, go for Nero 8 Ultra. It does this and about 21 other things. For ultimate off-site back-up (houses do burn down and kids will kill your PC); subscribe to Carbonite.",original
Ok to be clear I have to point out that the seller was great! I received the product early and it was packaged securely. The issue I have with this polish it that it NEVER DRIES. I love essie but the formula on this one is aweful. The color is gorgeous but it goes on pretty sheer so it takes 3 coats just to get to what you see in the bottle. BUT even with one coat (I tried it out just to see if it'd dry that way) it'll smudge as soon as you touch anything. The better buy would be sinful colors endless blue!! The colors are identical and the formula's great!,original

"I changed my Dell Duo from Windows 7 to this in order to gain more knowledge about the system.  I cannot understand why Microsoft made such a move.  Windows 8 is fine, I guess, for people who just like to play around with a computer but there is no comparison with Windows 7 when it comes to serious work.  Also, there are still many business applications that are not compatible with the system.  If you are more interested in graphics, touch screen utilization and have light business use, Windows 8 is probably okay for you.  Certainly, if you change, this method of changing is the way to go.  Software products from Amazon are great!",original

I had great success with using previous versions of Roxio Creator in the past - but this version 10 is the exception. It's not like I should be surprised, I read all the negative reviews here, but there were a couple of positive ones as well - so based on my previous experiences I took a chance.

The software installed fine, but even from the start I could tell that it ran slow... and it also slowed down my machine with all the stuff it was running in the background. I think I could have lived with that, as it did do a lot of what it was suppose to do. But the thing that made me uninstall it completely, was that it had the effect of making the audio of any video that was played in any player (like the regular Windows Media Player) play at a greatly reduced level. Even with all the settings cranked up to 11, you could barely hear the audio. And even worse, it had the same effect on anything that I tried to record - no matter what program you used. Systems sounds work fine, just the playback / recorded audio was affected. I tried everything to fix this audio problem - updated everything, downloaded drivers and reinstalled. Nothing worked. Uninstalled the complete Creator 10 package and now everything works fine! Just like it did before I installed the software. Well, I'll keep the software on the shelf for now - maybe some day they will get around to releasing a patch to make it work.... Just in case someone wonders, I'm running XP, not Vista.",original

"This is year 2 for me for Kaspersky.  Love the software, it works fine and is much less of a ""resource hog"" than Norton I.S. which we used for the prior 10 years or so.  That's the good news.

Here's the bad news.  The support from Kaspersky is subcontracted to Digital River and their Manila call center.  If you buy from Amazon, they will ask for your Kaspersky order number.  No Kaspersky order number, no assistance.  Period.  So, you are getting ""Support-less"" software when you buy it here.  I found this shocking.  My only question was where I had used 2 of the 3 seats or all 3 seats, since I had recently bought a new desktop, installed the software, but returned it due to a defect in the PC.  NO ONE AT DIGITAL RIVER COULD ANSWER MY SIMPLE QUESTION.  NOR DID THEY SEEM WILLING TO HELP.

So, the bottom line is that Amazon needs to look into this situation, because Kaspersky has instructed their call center not to assist customers who buy KIS software on Amazon.  It's as if it were counterfeit software.  So, IF YOU THINK YOU MIGHT EVER NEED SUPPORT, AT ANY TIME, then pay a few $$ more and buy this on the Kaspersky website, or get Norton Internet Security instead.

Meanwhile, I hope that Amazon Customer Service will look into this issue.  It is simple to verify what I have stated, just call the toll free number for Kaspersky support and ask them.",original

It's not horrible but it causes my upper arms and abdomen area to get an itchy, dry hives-like appearance.

"Like others have mentioned, when you buy this almost $200 program, you do not get a full package - it is merely a instrument for them to charge you subscription fees.  It reminds me of some shareware programs that disable features until you buy the full version, but in this case you have already bought the full version and they still want to get more money from you!  I'm sort of the ""go to"" guy in my circle of friends and family when it comes to technical and/or business software and even though I would never spend a penny on this, noticed a friend had purchased this so I decided to see for myself and it only reiterated how disgusting Intuit's business practices are.  Here are a few reasons why you should avoid this program:

Payroll.  The ability to write paychecks and pay income withholdings is one of the most basic accounting tools one would expect from a ""pro"" accounting package but it is missing from this program.  Even if you do it yourself, you have to pay an extra $200 each year to have the privilege downloading tax forms and you can only shell out the extra $200 for 3 years because after spending $600 in the end of the 3 years, you'll have to buy the newest version of Quickbooks.

Again, this is for DO IT YOURSELF!  You'll print the checks on your own paper, your own computer and all they'll do is give you the tax tables.  They can easily integrate the tax tables in the software but their excuse is that it may not be up to date.  That is a complete cop-out because all they would have to do to fix that is to let you adjust the table if rates go up or down;  besides, they require you to replace the program every 3 years anyway.

They used to offer one free tax table download in the older versions but they wanted more money and they got rid of that. There IS a hidden ""manual payroll"" option, but even if you can find it past all the ads for subscriptions, they get you if you want to print the forms for the IRS.  Yes, in order to use the same IRS forms that you can download for free from the IRS, you have to pay intuit for their integrated version.

file attachments
As others have mentioned, you have to pay to save attachments to invoices in your own computer!

bloatware
What was one a simple program now install a ton of nagware that you don't want with no option to shut it off.

no easy way to export
They know they got you so they don't have any tools to convert their files to other format.

/*****************************edit**************************************************/
I give up.  Intuit using their ""customer retention managers"" to pressure amazon to delete negative reviews and comments aside, since the changing of the new social security tax rate (employee end), I can no longer print my tax forms and at the begging of my CPA, I was convinced that I have to get the new version AND since the new version doesn't let you print tax forms without subscribing to ENHANCED PAYROLL AND PAYING EXTRA FOR THE UNLIMITED EMPLOYEES, this $200 program will cost me around $500 for the first year and around $300 each following year until they force me to upgrade again.

This is a MONOPOLY.  So enjoy my money for now Intuit, you have won this round. The time will come when the DOJ hits you with an anti-trust lawsuit, FTA will come down on you for making fake positive reviews, or an enterprising software company beats you at your own game.

******UPDATE 2*****
This is seriously as bad as everybody says.  Nagware everywhere.  I can't even click on a link before getting ""interviewed"" to see what spam they can sell me.  I've tried removing them but it's nowhere to be found in the options.

I subscribed to enhanced payroll and had to stay on tech support in India for an hour to figure out why the $300 I had just shelled out wasn't working.

"While iTunes is great for downloading and burning files, Apple users will no doubt discover that the included programs can be slow and cumbersome at other tasks, such as copying CD and DVD discs and recording analog sound and converting it to digital.  Toast will copy audio and video files as well as legal audio and video discs reliably and quickly (Toast 8 does so faster than Toast 6 and really ramps up the graphics).  And give Roxio credit for once again providing a hard-copy manual for this edition.

But Spin Doctor 2 is still Spin Doctor 2.  It's fairly accurate in sensing the tracks in an LP.  And conversion is relatively problem-free providing you don't start fooling with the filters.  Perhaps the problem of ""cleaning up"" those distorted, snap-crackle-pop vinyl discs is the same with any program.  For every gain, there's a loss--in frequencies, presence, naturalness.  I've found that it's not worth the hours of experimentation, though others may appreciate the feature, or know how it compares with similar programs.

The main problem with Spin Doctor becomes evident upon trying to edit, say, an hour-long radio broadcast.  Why Roxio would leave this bundled program unattended for the past several upgrades is a mystery.  I have yet to hear of anyone who actually found the bright and colorful wave formations practical for any sort of editing. Even when editing by the clock instead of the visual wave, it's impossible to attain precision accuracy.  Finally, unlike some other programs for recording FM analog programs to computer, Spin Doctor does not yet have a timer for starting an automated recording.

Unfortunate, because Toast is a user-friendly program, but if you're a Mac person looking for Cool-Edit precision plus automatic start, the comparably-priced Sound Edit is probably the best bet.  I'm presently dependent on iTunes, Toast 8, and Sound Edit.  With any luck, maybe by the time Toast 9 or 10 arrives, two will be plenty.",original

"This is a fairly painless upgrade, at least when done using the code bought directly from Amazon, but at the same time it irritates me that it is even needed.  My opinion is that Microsoft should have just sucked it up and put out a single version of Windows 8, even if doing so might have meant they would have a bunch of customers that would have had features they didn't need (which might have cost Microsoft some licensing fees to have included).

Realistically, not all users *need* what Windows 8 Pro adds into the OS (Operating System) compared to the core or base product, and I understand that.  Not including those features in every copy of Windows 8 that is ever installed shaves a little from the cost of the product and in turn that supposed savings can be passed through to customers that are buying new hardware and getting Windows 8 pre-installed on it.  On the other hand, the MSRP on this item is not all that consumer friendly.  Granted, customers are getting something for that money, but what they get is relatively little return for the investment.

In my case I wanted the media center components that aren't included in the core/base product and the only way to get them is to upgrade to Windows 8 Pro.  Note that these components were built-in with Windows 7, so losing them in Windows 8, or at least having to pay separately to get them seems to just be an effort to pump up the profit margin for Microsoft.

The more irritating thing, for me, with Windows 8 is that most OEMs only offer Windows 8 core/basic on their hardware.  If Windows 8 Pro was an option at time of purchase, it would likely cost less than the upgrade fee charged for this product.

How long until Mr. Ballmer retires at Microsoft?  Dare we hope that whomever replaces him is someone that find a way to treat Microsoft's user community like customers rather than like people that will take anything you throw at them and pay for it no matter what?",original

"EDIT, 1/30/13:  I bought two Win8 upgrades of the twin DVDs for each 32-bit and 64-bit.  I will install them on laptops whose drives are easily switched out post-clone, so not to disturb the original drives.  In short, clone original drive, switch it out, pop in a new drive, clone back to that drive, then partition, then put Win8 in its own partition, then switch out again.  This is one dangerous OS.  The reviews later than mine here for 1/10/13 report more horrors post-installation than I'd have imagined.  The laptops I bought for this were Dell Latitude 6530, 6510.  The other Dell laptop with an easily switched-out-drive is the D630.  But its memory is expensive.  Memory for the 6530 and 6510 runs only about $35 per 4 GB. In short, Win8 will NEVER be on a mission-critical machine, and NEVER be on a mission-critical original internal drive.  Comparable Precision models are 2400, 4400, 6500 (which uses same internal HDD as the 6530), 6600-6700.  Precision models are more expensive.  Dell's memory is easy to change (except on the D630, where the DIMM A module is below the keyboard, lol).  So if you're debating whether to install Win8, get a used Dell laptop in dellauction, DFS, or Dell Outlet.  If it's after January 31 when you want to install, don't upgrade at all.  The real cost of this upgrade is in the HUNDREDS of hours' frustration you'll have in trying to learn and use it.  For that reason, I won't install Win8 until maybe a year from now, or whenever reports of it regaining sanity and stability, come out.

Partition size should at least be 80 GB, because Win8 might impose a recovery/restore file.  That file is at least 22 GB, which is the Win7 file size.  Atop that, you need space for the Recycle Bin, paging file, other junk.  So figure 80 GB or 60 GB at smallest, for a Windows 8 partition.  Put all your other programs and files elsewhere, back up your registry regularly.  Win8 forces you to be online more often, so you are at greater risk.

Original review follows below, before the upgrades arrived.  Those upgrades are still in their little sealed boxes, unopened.  The boxes are the size of a CD.

=========
I made Youtube videos on Win8 as 'brainouty'.  My videos aren't worth watching, but the video descriptions ARE worth reading: they contain a lot of links relevant to Win8 installation and usage, from users installing, and from computer magazines online, forums, etc.  See also my posts in PC World, which often contain links to other places.  Yeah, and maybe ignore my irritation in those posts.  I need Bible's 1John1:9 every 30 seconds, when working with Windows: sorry!

Oh, understand this clearly:  I'm MIFFED that I have to move to Linux, in order to avoid this OS.  I'm not an MS hater, but an XP fan -- just bought four more XP Pro OS here in Amazon.  Linux will be used for internetting and email when the support for XP ends.  That way XP security will remain, as Linux for COMPUTERS is not popularly or easily targeted by hackers.  (Android is another story.)  Besides, XP's security has matured after 11 years.  Win8's just born, and its security is untested.

So you see: I'm not an MS hater.  That said, here's the review:

=======================================================
Windows 8 pro-purchase: none, for an experienced computer desktop user.
=======================================================

Might be worth upgrading, if you like poking touchscreens; for that's the essential difference in Win8 (ignoring the new garishly annoying 'tiles' on the Start Screen which replaces the Start Menu).  If you have big screens sitting over 8"" from your face, you won't want this software.  They made Win8 for touch, to compete with Apple and Android;  so mouse or touchpad, keyboard equivalents are awful.  Gone is the easy way to shut down, close a window, open multiple windows, change options.  It's all hide-and-seek now.  Plus, the screen response is MUCH slower.  You're supposed to get the thrill of watching a 'page' turn, the screen glide horizontally.  So it's DELIBERATELY slower.  Blecch.

MS chirpers boast about 'fast boot times'.  Honey, I had to DISABLE fast boot on my Win98, XP, VISTA, and Win7 machines, so I'd have enough time to select the boot menu at startup, in case something went wrong.  The last thing you want is fast boot times, for then you bypass your ability to STOP the machine from hanging up.  Go get a cup of coffee when you boot.  Every Windows system, if new or tuned, boots in a minute or so.  Depending on what other programs you have scheduled to run at start up, it can take longer.  But just wait:  Win8 will be as slow as molasses, just like every other Windows OS, after it ages with the many 'updates' you'll have to get, to fix the OS bugs.

MS chirpers also boast about 'safer'.  Baloney.  IE10 and the OS had security fixes in the first week!  And there are still problems.  If anything, Win8 is more susceptible to attack, because it imposes these LIVE TILES on you at boot up, and you can't really use it well unless you sign on with a Microsoft Account you create.  In short, you're ONLINE most of the time, that's what this OS is designed for;  so, you'll be under more attack, not less.

==========================================
Windows 8 contra-purchase:  keep reading this review. :)
==========================================

A) I bought it, B) I hate it, and C) it hasn't even arrived yet.  Bought it, because of the January 31 deadline, and needed to get that product key for the Media Center so at least I can play my DVD drive so I can maybe INSTALL something after Win8 disables the drive, post-installation.  NOTE: if you install 'plain' Win8, your DVD drive will become disabled;  but if you use the PRO upgrade here, the DVD/CD drives are supposed to keep working.  Will see.

B) Hate it, for 3000 reasons, most of which are covered by other reviewers, to wit:
=======================================================
1.  Installation is VERY GLITCHY.
=======================================================

So be sure to clone your existing drive with Clonezilla (be sure the destination clone drive is about the same size as the original);  both Clonezilla and the destination drives (i.e., from Jacob's parts) are here in Amazon.  Expect your drivers not to work, your internet not to work (way to go, MS, disable the customer from troubleshooting your buggy installer), your programs not to work, if you install ON TOP OF the existing OS.  Better still, first partition your drive (if drive is greater than 100 GB), and install Win8 on a newly-created and formatted PARTITION.  You can do that with Clonezilla, too (which is a flavor of Linux), but most recommend you partition a Windows disk with Windows.  So maybe do that first, before you clone.  Then do a 'custom' install to install to the partition.  Oh: and keep your data on a different drive, because from Win7 forward, RESTORE and REFRESH don't exactly work as advertised.  You lose data and programs sometimes yes, sometimes no.  NOTHING BEATS CLONING.  For the clone drive is a live and bootable copy of your hard drive.  DO IT.

REMOVE any anti-virus or disk management software prior to installation, if you'll not do a clean install.  The reviews I've read often report aborted installations due to those things (i.e., Kapersky, Norton, Acronis) being on the machine.

MAKE SURE that UEFI boot is NOT enabled;  Windows 8 changes your BIOS, if UEFI is enabled, and you really don't want that -- it will be very difficult to recover your old system if it's enabled and you decide Win8 is not for you. Basically, a 'UEFI' is a traffic cop between your OS and your machine which stops any boot without a pre-authorized 'signature' being sent to the computer;  so, your machine is effectively DEAD. But how to do this?  First, if your machine is about a year old, you may have this problem;  even then, it seems to affect only 64-bit installations.  Google on 'uefi boot option', and then find superuser(dot)com for the most comprehensive explanation on this problem I could find.  (I can't put the link in here.)

So: if you have it, you should see something like 'Legacy' or 'UEFI' on a screen, waiting for you to select it; should be in your system setup prior to booting in Windows.  If you select/enable UEFI, then maybe you won't be able to dual-boot with some other OS, later;  because, some systems thereafter HIDE the option.  So that's a problem, for Win8 DOES NOT UNINSTALL, as the instructions to the upgrade here in Amazon, warned.  If UEFI is enabled, not sure you can even clone back, to get rid of Win8. For the UEFI option creates a hidden partition on your hard drive which runs first in the boot sequence -- and maybe you can't reformat that partition, either.  Real pain in the neck.

NOTE: if you don't see a 'UEFI' option, you probably don't have it, so your computer will NOT be locked by Win8 installation.  Win8 is supposed to warn you it can't use 'secure boot', when you install: if it does, SMILE BROADLY, grateful to Heaven you're not religiously tyrannized from deciding how YOU want to use your own machine!

NOTE 2: Apparently all Dell workstations and mobile machines beginning with the Latitude 6410 (or near that vintage), have this 'UEFI' option, and you CAN turn it off (by selecting 'Legacy', instead);  the UEFI thingy began with Windows 7, in 2009.  So if your machine is older than that, you don't have it;  if you don't have Win7, you don't have the UEFI problem;  and if you have Windows 7, you'd already know about UEFI, as that was an issue in Windows 7 installation. One final way to check:  do you have an 'MBR' (master boot record) partition?  If 'yes', then likely you DO NOT have UEFI, because then an option to 'enable' it (radio button next to 'UEFI' in system setup) would be present.  Whew.

MAKE SURE that AHCI is enabled.  Again, settings are in your system setup prior to booting in Windows.  Older machines might not have AHCI, or might not have it enabled.  AHCI controls how your DVD drives work, versus your other storage (like, your internal hard drive).  Apparently Win8 glitches up if AHCI isn't enabled, as reported by some users on the internet.  Again, if you don't see an option to enable it, don't worry.

===> What's great about this Amazon deal (hence at least one star) is that you get BOTH 32-bit and 64-bit disks.  FAR BETTER TO USE THE DISKS THAN TO DOWNLOAD THE PROGRAM FROM MICROSOFT.  Most installation complaints are by people who downloaded from Microsoft for the $15 or $40.  Many problems reported:  aborted installations with many retries;  12+ hours simply to download (for MS servers control the rate, not your IP); worst of all, the download was keyed to the computer used, so (example) if you were on 32-bit Vista at the time, you got a 32-bit Win8 keyed to THAT Vista machine.  In short, the MS download is CUSTOMIZED, not generic.  So if you value your sanity, get these disks here in Amazon, instead. Pay the extra $27-52 here, unless you love waste and pain.

===> here, you get BOTH 32-bit and 64-bit, as just said.  So look: I can install Win8, yell at it, then uninstall via clone-back and install Win8 later on something else -- probably also test 64-bit (to test DOSBOX and Taos Computing's DOS emulator).  So I get two experiences for the price of one.  The 64-bit use might actually be worthwhile.  Will see.

=====================================
DVD/CD Read/Write/PLAY ISSUES, post-installation:
=====================================

Allegedly, if you're installing Win8 Pro from these disks instead of downloading from MS, your DVD drive will still work, afterwards.  I'm not taking any chances, but will download VLC player (which also works in Linux) before I shut down, post-install.  I actually plan on triple-partitioning the drive, with the existing OS first (which will likely be Vista), then Linux in some flavor, leaving a third partition for Win8. I will then custom install it to that third partition, in 32-bit.

IMPORTANT:  Windows Media Player won't necessarily work in Win8.  Instead, to play DVDs, you'll need the 'free' Media Center.  To get that, you have to go online to MS and give them your email, wait for a 'product key' to be mailed to you, which you have to use AFTER installing Win8 but BEFORE January 31.  Supposed to be five per customer, but to get that, you have to use five email addresses. If you do NOT install the 'free' version prior to January 31, your product key won't work.

SUGGESTION: Bite the bullet and pay for Media Center ($10!) after January 31, downloading it then from MS.  The downloaded PAID version will enable your Blu-Ray player;  the 'free' version will disable the Blu-Ray player.  LOL can MS give you more DISincentive to buy?  Did the people who designed this OS sit around a conference table with lattes, asking each other, 'how can we best alienate the customer, today?'

=======================================================
2.  COMPATIBILITY with hardware is also very glitchy.
=======================================================

After reading 3000 reviews here in Amazon, new egg, TigerDirect and elsewhere (i.e., in comments and in computer magazines), it seems that the following hardware is problemmatic when Win8 installs (please add comments if I missed your own hardware glitch):

* HP/Compaq computer and printer hardware -- they won't allow you to back-grade to Win7, but apparently the drivers in HP when you're not YET on Win8, don't function after Win8 installation.  Lots of problems reported, here in Amazon.
* Sony -- Sony has a lot of proprietary adjustments in their stuff, and it works or often fails when Windows installations are done.
*Graphics Cards, Nvidia or ATI Radeon -- problems with the drivers not being compatible.
*Touchpads -- maybe won't work post-installation.
*PROCESSORS -- Pentium 4 won't work, but Windows 8 advisor claims it will.  Some other processors might not work, as well.  In short, your installation might abort, or after installation and shutdown you might not be able to get the machine on again, due to the processor being incompatible.  But you won't know that, nothing tells you what's the problem.
*WEBCAMS -- Logitech in particular might not work.  Don't know if any embedded laptop webcams will work.  Driver problems.
*ROUTERS in your house. This too is a driver problem.  Some routers really have problems with Win8, so maybe first go to your router maker's site and see if there are any known problems.  Or, Google.
*64-bit installations are more prone to problems than 32-bit.  So if you have 32-bit now, STAY on it.  You can always change later, especially since you get both 32-bit and 64-bit installers in this Amazon-purchased package.
*1GB-RAM machines.  Win8 is supposed to be more compatible with low memory, but Pro requires 2GB, and you really need 4GB if you want smooth operation.  It's really tough to play videos or surf with 1GB, unless you have good broadband like XFINITY.  So if you have XFINITY, reserve your 1GB machine for internet and your TV hookup, or upgrade your RAM before moving to Win8 Pro.
*Upgrades from Windows prior to Win7 are more glitchy.  CLONE FIRST.  You can only migrate your settings from Vista, and you can't migrate anything from XP.  So that will mean lost programs, lost drivers, lost a lot of things.  When my registry died on my XP in May-June (twice), it cost me three months to rebuild the thing, for back then I didn't know about cloning.  So CLONE FIRST.  Costs $8 for Clonezilla CD (I like their $60 USB, too), and maybe $30-$100 for an external hard drive the same size as your internal drive.  WORTH IT.

--->  Ask people you know, who HAPPILY installed Win8 on their machines, what brands and processors, graphics cards, etc. that they have.  Frankly, you can spend $200 and just buy a cheap netbook to try Win8, leaving your main machine alone.  Then buy the upgrade here, if you're happy with Win8 function.  If not happy, you can always sell the cheap netbook here on Amazon, or to a friend. :)

Dell machines seem to be the most compatible with Win8.  So I'm buying a Dell D630 to use as my test machine.

=======================================================
3.  COMPATIBILITY with software is weird and conflicting.
=======================================================

Win8 will tell you it can't handle MS Office prior to 2010, but users tell me they can even get old Office 2000 on their Win8's.  I'll be testing it with DOS Lotus 1-2-3 version 2.01, on 32-bit Win8, and other software from 2003 and prior.  That's why I got Win8, to see first-hand how bad it is.  Most of the software-incompatible complaints come from 64-bit or Adobe and Photoshop users.  Graphics display problems, colors wrong, formatting weird, colorspace problems in particular.  Probably every utility program you had pre-Win8, won't work.  Anything which makes direct calls to the hardware or to the OS, or uses context menus in prior versions of Windows, will likely not install or cause the machine to freeze.  Same problem happens in Win7, especially with respect to programs that use the context menu (meaning: the pop-up menu when you right-click, in XP, Vista, Win7).

DEALBREAKER?  YOU LOSE YOUR EMAIL CLIENT after installation. Win8 is not compatible with old Win7 mail, nor Vista Mail, and of course isn't compatible with Outlook Express.  So move your mail to full Outlook, back up, then pray.  If you only use online email composition, then you might actually prefer Win8, because if you create an MS account when you first install, it will then take you through the steps to consolidate your email: but you can't compose offline.  I hate composing online, so I hate this 'new' feature.  But Outlook 2010 might work for you.  I don't like any Outlook after 2000, so will try and install that, see if it works.

=======================================================
4.  NAVIGATION in Win8 is disorienting.
=======================================================

Remember Kurt Vonnegut's 'Breakfast of Champions'?  Where the guy was in WWII Dresden, then suddenly on a planet living in a glass orb -- watched by aliens -- having no idea or control how he'd flip from one world to the other?  Win8 works just like that book/movie!  One minute you're in the desktop, doing something normal and productive, then ZAP!  You're back in the Start Screen again!  Why?  Because something you did in the desktop, actually called forth some program in the Start Screen TEMPORARILY, after which you're supposed to return to the desktop.  But, sometimes you don't.  It's kinda like going into your bedroom to pick up the socks, then you see the plant needs watering so you go to the kitchen, then you see the dishes need doing so you wash them.. and then you forgot about both plant and socks.

Guess guess ugly interface schizoid operation made for XBox kiddies who have no discernment except to poke at a screen.  Just go look at the Youtube videos on Win8, watch how they navigate and use the OS, and you'll see how it works.  It's not hard to learn, it's ANNOYING to learn and even MORE ANNOYING to use.  MS hates its customers, always wants to make them play 'guess how to find me or use me' with each new OS they put out.  And in Win8, they want to control your 'experience' to seeing EASTER EGG HUNT TILES OF MS PRODUCTS when you boot up.  Really childish.  As a result, I'll gradually move to Linux.  But I still have to buy ONE copy of this garbage to learn it, in case a client asks me how to send an email or open a file, and all he has, is Win8.

=================================================================================
5.  OPERATION of value will be its desktop, which allegedly is like Win7.  But ooops: no Start Menu!
=================================================================================

A Start Menu in prior versions of Windows was handy to organize and 'park' your program shortcuts.  YOU chose where they were organized, YOU designed the folders and icons and whatever to remind YOU what and where they were, and YOU controlled how YOU wanted to see that stuff displayed.  Totally.  Well, that productive tool -- in use since Windows 95 -- is gone, in Win8.  Seriously:  it's as if MS had INTENDED to destroy the best interface features of Windows.  So of course, you can't customize the icons and background, like before.  God forbid you want to preserve your eyesight by muted shades and graphics, rather than GLARE TILES with a GLARE background, no matter what color you choose, excepting sleepy gray!  Windows 3.1, all over again!

Here, the MS chirpers will chorus that many THIRD PARTY add-ins restore your Start Menu.  Not really. There are hundreds of these programs you must TRY and then INSTALL and then USE to recover some of the functionality you had.  But now you spent effort and time searching through all these programs; every update to Win8, will maybe necessitate updating these programs, too.  So guess what? Now your day is spent on tweaking and updates.. not on working.  Did someone in Redmond call an in-house meeting, on 'How To Create World Inflation. Quickly'?

So I wonder how No-Win8, will truly resemble Win7.  XP is far better than both; but Win7 happily formats DVDs; its MovieMaker 6.0 is fabulous.  Win7's Help actually helps (what a shock).  Excepting Explorer (that Win8 essentially obliterates) Win7's reorganized options are pretty decent and intuitive.  So I'm dying to see if I can override Win8's interface the way I overrode Win7, resulting in a 'classic' interface (meaning, like Win98, replete with Start Menu!) across all my (soon to be 14) Windows machines.  See my 'Vista versus Win7' thread in PC World, if you're interested in that.

======================

C) So my Win8 Pro upgrade will arrive in a few days, allowing me to buy a Dell D630 for Win8 installation.  Someone here in the Amazon comments said that model worked well with Win8. The Dell machine's design is fabulous -- internal hard drive, just slides out after removing two screws on the back!  Machine is for sale here in Amazon.  I made a video on it, too.

Alas, the D630's memory is slow, only 800MHz.  Still, that moseying RAM fits the pokey Win8 OS:  for you are expected to SIGH or drool,  while its tiles waft lazily across the screen, just as in any tablet;  then, you again swipe, sigh, drool.. one 'page' of tiles at a time.  Oh wait: you can also type the first three or four letters of the file you want, and magically 'search' appears with the many tiles answering that description.  Hmmm.  So now you have to TYPE and SWIPE?  Sheesh.

So I won't do a more personal review, for awhile.  Then my rant here will gradually suffer edit. I did nearly six months of intensive research on Win8 installation and operation, prior to buying.  Still, would love to be wrong -- if the 'right' answer is good.  :)",original

"I have experimented with countless powders in all price ranges, and I'd say this is mediocre. About 2 hours after applying, my face is shiny and oily again, whether I use this over moisturizer, sunscreen, concealer, foundation, or any combination thereof. This defeats the purpose of a setting powder for me.

This looks white in the compact but is translucent on the skin once blended with a powder brush. The included puff can cause it to clump up on the face, but the brush picks up enough powder to distribute it evenly and blend. It's not chalky, and you can pick some up out of the compact just by brushing your finger across the powder, which are two qualities that put this ahead of some setting powders. For the price, though, there are similar options at the drugstore.

I have oily, reactive adult skin that is very prone to irritation and breakouts. I believe this worsened some existing small pimples and may have clogged pores on my nose and cheeks, but it didn't cause a horrible reaction or result in unmanageable acne breakouts as some powders have. The ingredients are minimal, which is a good thing for acne prone skin. In the end, the fact that did nothing to help combat shine, along with the fact that I believe it may have worsened clogged pores, caused me to return it.",original

"There is little to like and a lot to dislike about this program.  It insists on making you operate its way, and tries to force you to schedule everything, schedule, schedule, schedule. ""Do it our way, and do it when we damned well tell you to do it.""

For example, when you just want to do a quick backup, it has all sorts of calender nonsense, even though it's just a backup.  It won't use your name for the backup, so you end up with backup1, backup2, backup3, etc., with no easy clue as to when it was made and what is in the backup.  It does not have conventional menus to get you where you need to go, you have to fumble around and try to find something that looks like it might be what you want.  But few of the usual options are available.  In other words, the programmers are so convinced that you are stupid and have no idea what you want, that they have made it essentially useless.

There there is the fact that it takes up a whopping 123 mb on your disk, and forces you to load a ""service"" that runs all the time, slowing down and clogging up your machine (and perhaps conflicting with a program you really need). Yet another program by programmers who apparently believe that your only purpose in having a computer is running their ""wonderful"" software.

My son has a previous version of this software that I've used on his machine, and although I didn't like it much, at least it was functional.  I can't say the same about 2009.

I have to update my review.  The 1st review was on the check register, this review is on the investment register.  Horrible downgrades they have made to this software.  Like several others I am seriously considering going back to my previous version and forgoing any connectivity with stock updates.  Transactions don't enter when accept them and it reenters a previous one.  it takes so long to register that you think you didn't click and you enter the transaction again.  And, OH the developers are oh so much smarter than the user.  Give me a break, and give us back control of the software.

12/12/13
I hate software that thinks it is smarter than you.  They have made changes to the renaming rules that are completely annoying.  My bank names all checks as CHECK.  Quicken wants to apply one rule to CHECK and won't stop bugging me about it.  And the ignore rule does not work.  Every check is now a multi step process to code with the correct payee.  Then it wants to compare transactions that have absolutely nothing in common.

Bottom line, don't upgrade to QUICKEN 2014 unless you have to because you are at  the 3 year limit they have imposed for getting stock quotes downloaded.  I haven't seen enough positive changes in the software to justify buying it.",original

After nearly 2 weeks of email tech support and 7 hours on the phone with Norton, their final solution was that since the problem was with Internet Explorer, I had to contact Microsoft.  I called Microsoft and they downloaded a program called SuperSpyWare Professional trial version and it immediately found that the computer was infected by 2 trojans.  These infected my system while Norton was running and supposedly protecting it.  Also, Norton scans had just come up fine.  As soon as these 2 trojans were removed, all the problems with the computer were gone.  I now know I CAN NO LONGER TRUST NORTON TO PROTECT MY COMPUTER.

"There is nothing drastically wrong with these cards.  My one complaint is that I still have some of the traditional size Hallmark Card stock and the envelopes that come with those have the Hallmark emblem on the back flap of the card.  Since I'm using the Hallmark Card software and card stock, it was an important element that made the cards look and feel more ""professional.""  The traditional size is not made any more, which is bad enough, but to find that these new Hallmark cards do not even have the Hallmark logo embedded on the back flap of the envelope was a disappointment.  This makes it so there is no compelling reason to buy the Hallmark card stock rather than card stock made by your printer manufacturer.  Supposedly, papers made by the printer manufacturer are made to work specifically with that brand ink so why bother to buy the Hallmark paper?  I did notice that the cards seem to go through the HP printer easier with fewer roller marks.  To me though, this is just a matter of two negatives cancelling each other out.  One, the Hallmark paper feels to me to be a bit thinner and the second negative is that HP printer design would leave any roller marks at all on photo card paper made by HP.  Not much of a reason to buy the Hallmark cards (but not much of a recommendation for HP photo card stock or printers when they can't even produce a card that prints perfectly when everything is in perfect condition on the HP printer.)",original

"This curling iron made unpredictable curls, and then they didn't hold. I have thick but fine almost shoulder-length hair. For years, I have been using the Hot Tools gold-plated 1.25"" iron. Recently, my hair became EVEN more curl-resistant than it had been in the past. So I thought I'd try a smaller diameter barrel. I stayed with the same brand and style, but changed to this model with the tourmaline finish. So, I'm going to return it and order the Hot Tools 1"" with the gold finish, and see if that does the trick.

This curling iron is nice, except for the problem I wrote about above, and it does not burn my hair or smell bad even at the highest setting. Maybe it would work for others.

Update: I received the new Hot Tools 1"" iron with gold finish, and yes it worked much better for my hair than this one. Made curls that would go in the direction (under or flipped) I intended, and they last longer.

PS - and yes, I did try the hottest setting, using small sections of hair, and holding the curls for six seconds each, a number I saw an online video as being how long you need to hold for curl-resistant hair.",original

"As a avid user of the older paperport 8 product I was hoping that I would love the improvements in paperport 12. Alas, not so much. I didn't have the disabling issues described by so many other reviewers causing big problems immediately. I found it was much slower than the older version and didn't offer any features that were compelling for the upgrade price.

It just seems more difficult to use and less dependable. If I'm doing a sequence of operations where I save something it never remembers the last folder. My scanner internmittently driver hangs with this version, apparently during transfer of the scanned item to paperport. Closing paperport and reopening it seems to resolve this issue until the next time.

For me this wasn't really an upgrade. Since I'm still running XP I probably should have stuck with version 8.",original

"I bought Webroot SecureAnywhere Antivirus 2013 because it was highly rated in a prominent computer website. Part of the high rating was for good system performance. That wasn't my experience.

My mouse arrow was slow to respond and I often saw the spinning circle telling me to wait for functions that used to happen quickly.

My computer is now fast again. Avast Internet Security doesn't get as good a review as Webroot SecureAnywhere Antivirus, but I get to use my computer.

"If you follow Quicken, you may recalled my review of Quicken Deluxe 2008. My main complaint was that the date field would revert to the current date whenever I temporarily left the entry to do something else. Frequently I ended up with several incorrect dates and had to go back and fix them.  Also I should mention that I only use the check registry and no other features.  This annoyance has been mostly corrected. You can go to Find, for example, and then return to the entry and the entered date will still be there.  If you wander too far, the date may revert, but the main problem has been resolved.  So far as I am concerned, this would be the main reason to upgrade from the 2008 version.

I did not find the new features useful.  I cannot make the ""flag"" feature do anything, so I gave up on it.  Now I would like to make OCCASIONAL use of the Tag and Notes features, but to do that, I would have to make them  available.  The problem is that this would add two extra keystrokes when entering a check as the Amount column is at the end.  Quicken claims that you can arrange the register's columns anyway you like, but I found I could not move the Amount column to be next to the Category field so as to avoid the extra keystrokes.  You would think that fields that are not used for every entry would be placed after the Amount field which has to be filled in for every entry.  Of course one could theoretically hide Tag and Notes and call them up only when needed, but surely the information on them ought to be visible all the time so that one does not overlook it. In any event, it is much easier to stick a notation into the Memo field rather than call up two other fields from time to time.

In all fairness, I think the Attachment feature might be useful but I have not yet have had occasion to try it.
In conclusion, if you do not yet have a program for keeping track of your checks or finances, I would strongly recommend Quicken Deluxe 2011.  Over the many years I have used Quicken, it has undoubtedly saved me hundreds of dollars in duplicate contributions or extended subscriptions, and thousands of hours of time. But if you already have a version of Quicken that works on your computer, and which you like, you may not need to upgrade.",original

"I have always used Turbotax and been totaly satisfied, but this year has proven that Intuit can ruin even a great product for some users.

First, it saves major time in transferring data from prior years' TurboTax-prepared tax returns (as far as I can tell) with impeccable precision.

But for the first time, TurboTax fails to transfer and translate many foreign currency transactions, just plugging the foreign currency as US Dollars. This was not the case in any of the past 10 years - or at least I hope not, or the IRS is going to send me to jail for life for tax fraud or some other pretext.

Also for the first time, Turbotax 2012 will not transfer data from a two-year old Quicken (2010) program, the license of which is valid for 2012, forcing the user either to upgrade to Quicken 2013, an horrifically sub-standard and under-tested piece of software, or manually transfer the data one account at a time.

I did a family member's US Domestic tax return with absolute precision and ease, transferring Quicken 2011 data with ease, so if you have no foreign entanglements you should find this program a joy to own and use, and I highly recommend TurboTax.

But should you have a Sheckel or a Pound, an Euro or a Baht, an Yuan or a Ruble in your accounts, you will have to carefully ensure you don't transgress the US Tax Monster, taking every precaution  - because the Intuit developers have not.

A bloody shame.

Almost every time TurboTax is opened, it asks if you want to check for updates.

Updating today, TurboTax Premier is replaced by TurboTax Basic, and the message is ""your configuration has changed, please re-install"" - so, obediently, I try. No Go. Have to re-download from Amazon. Okay, there went another fifteen minutes down the drain. Then: ""There is another version of TurboTax 2012. Please uninstall."" More minutes. Finally, after more than three quarters of an hour wasted, the new program is installed, all the ""check here"" boxes checked, and it too only 46 minutes - oops, had to check for updates again, one more update, then at last TurboTax opens! Total now 49 minutes to open file. $%^&*!!!!",original

"As a user coming from Microsoft Money, I was not at all pleased with this product. I work with computers daily and adapt to new & changed applications and ways of doing things on computers on a regular basis.  I've also been an MS Money user since version 2002 or before. Microsoft has stopped making Money and will stop producing it and support it soon. As an offer from Quicken embedded in MS Money as an advertisement, I was invited to buy Quick with a discount.

I found the product was cheaper on Amazon.com, so I bought it here with no ""discount"".

One major gotcha is the Quicken automatically scans your history for recurring payments and creates reminders for them.  If you have reminders set up in MS Money, you are supposed to ""delete all reminders"" before importing the data into Quicken... but nothing during the import process says this, nor in the non-existent instructions but after searching for the problem in the support forums I found out what I should have done.... So I was off to a bad start from the very beginning.

So that problem being what it was, I started exploring the interface. I was entirely, totally lost.  This is not really the fault of the company, as I'm used to a competitors product, so I tried to do a bit of exploring and really didn't find myself happy with what I was seeing.

So... eventually I'm probably going to end up using this product.  Eventually I'll probably know how to use it. But until then, without any better migration tools or instructions, I am going to take my chances with MS Money and be very happy, pleased and ""quick in"" my money matters...",original
"Customers should be very careful with this product.  It has some very handy features but they come bundled with some nasty surprises.

I consider myself to be a long-standing highly-experienced computer user.  I starting building home-brew computers in the mid 70s.  However, I did not anticipate that this version of Norton Utilities would wreak such damage to my computer settings.

Of course, many cookies are intrusive and dangerous and should be deleted.  But many cookies are extremely valuable -- on a secure home computer.  This version of Norton Utilities deleted every cookie (good, bad, and in between) without ever asking whether I might want to keep any.  In addition, it added an extension to my browser that slowed it to a crawl.  The resulting page would have no formatting.  If I refreshed the page the formatting would appear.  Also, my Quicken passwords have suddenly disappeared.

I have taught thousands of university-level computer science students.  I am embarrassed at the number of my C students who have graduated and are now producing commercial software.  However, this version of Norton would not get a passing grade.

"I was happy to get this software today.  I anxiously installed it.  The first thing was that a newer version was available, so I tried to download and install it.  It failed, and an error message came up saying there is a ""known problem"" and ""strongly recommended"" a manual download/install.  It provided some very confusing instructions, but I'm fairly competent with computers, so I managed to manually download/install the new version.

The most disturbing feature was that during every restart of the computer, prior to Windows loading, a Acronis page appears, making you select to go to one of the Acronis applications or you MUST select Windows to go to a ""normal"" Windows startup. I went to ""MSConfig"" to the ""Startup"" and ""Services"" tabs and shut down anything regarding Acronis.  But I couldn't kill the Acronis startup page.  So, I explored the program, under tools but didn't find any help.  There was an ""Options"" button, but it didn't work (deactivated?).  I looked under ""help"", again without results.  I tried ""Customer Service"" links, but they were deactivated (I wonder why???).  I tried looking though the history of problems others were having, and was amazed that such a new program would have volumes of problems reported already.

So, I went to the control panel and uninstalled the program.  Unfortunately, afterward, the Windows backup and restore functions no longer worked.  I was able to complete a ""system restore"" and recovered the Windows backup and restore.

I use Windows backup and restore and Norton Ghost, but I'm not going to touch a Acronis product again!  Yuck!",original
"I have been buying each version of this program for many years. This time, I really think that Microsoft simply did a text replace operation 2010 --> 2011 and shipped the thing out. The 2011 program seems to be bug-for-bug identical to the 2010 iteration.

Were any maps updated for 2011? Maybe. I don't have the resources to check this. Here is one data point. Over a year ago, a new freeway entrance was added near my home. A few months ago, the maps on my TomTom GPS were updated to include this. Finally. But Microsoft Streets & Trips 2011 does not include the new freeway entrance.

At this point, I could copy and paste my review for Microsoft Streets 2010 right here. Nothing has changed! The maps are still very good, although perhaps becoming old. The user interface is great, except for Microsoft's treatment of ""bookmarks."" Searching, editing, and organizing saved locations is primitive and inconvenient.

As in previous versions, maps will not print out at 1200 DPI (dots per inch). I can print them at 600 DPI though. I have tested this on three different printers.

I use this program from Windows 7 and it installed cleanly. However, I cannot launch it in the normal fashion. Windows complains that the program was not installed properly. The solution to this problem is to always launch the program with administrative privilege. This is slightly inconvenient.

If anyone finds a difference between this program and the 2010 version, please post your findings.",original

"One would think that after so many years at it, H&R Block would be a lot further ahead with its tax software package, but it is more or less the same old thing, revised every year, but no dramatic improvements.

Another surprise, installation woes. Windows 7 in 2012, and you still can't install a simple program without issues. In my case, on a quadcore AMD 64-bit Windows 7 computer. On the third installation attempt, the Program Compatibility Assistant finally sorted it out on its own and the darned thing installed.

After the successful installation, you run the software for the first time. You have the option to register it, and then it automatically checks for updates on the internet.

From within the program, you can then select to install the State Program. You get one free State program with this version, but not a free state e-file. You can purchase additional State programs if you need multiple states. Installation of the State program is a program installation in itself, you have to close the H&R software and go through the installers.

Preparing taxes was the usual routine, going through the different Q&A screens, and on and on. Navigation, usability, and explanations could have been better. The e-filing part worked without issue. The Search feature is borderline useless, it looks like something from 1999. The program gets things done when you slog through it, but after so many years at it, it should have been a lot better at it.

Another major point of irritation: you get five free federal e-files and zero state e-files. It would be more fair if they offered five free e-files and it would be up to the consumer to decide how to use them, federal or state or a combination! Overall it does what it's supposed to do, in a rather clumsy fashion, but you can get things done.

I have not used the customer support or live help options, so I can't comment on them.

Even though I have been using this program for many years, it is disappointing to see how little things have changed in terms of user-friendliness and installation and operations.

For the first time in years, I am considering whether to switch to something else for the following tax year.",original

"September 9, 2013 UPDATE
This shabby bloated software only gets worse.  With several GIGABYTES RAM it still cannot run Outlook without freezing.  I tried several cleanup programs (System Mechanic, CCleanup) and Windows 8 STILL WON'T RUN PROPERLY.  No wonder the CEO is quitting.  I would abandon ship too if I ran this company into the ground.

October 2012
What a step backwards.
I'm still trying to figure how to find the start program lineup.
Takes so much time to learn.
Counter-intuitive. Unlike Apple, this requires a manual.  Which of course is not included.
I am so tired of having to learn new commands.  There aren't even icons to click ... unless you buy Microsoft's cloud offerings. I can imagine how reliable those are.
It's like going back to DOS where you have to learn and remember commands.
What a waste of time.  And money.

In addition - if you have the Vista Home Premium - you can NOT use the Windows 7 Professional upgrade.

"Having used Quicken in the various encarnations, I will say that I like the product.  Why give it a poor rating you say?  My main issue with quicken is that the product is great until you get to the end of life which is usually 2 to 3 yrs and then most of the functionality of it becomes useless, which in fact, forces you to upgrade.

Quicken 2013 seems to be very buggy as well and has had 10 updates since its initial release.  One I found right away was trying to convert a graph to a pdf file to save, that is buggy at best and doesnt appear to work properly.

It is illuminating, but with sparkles, which I didn't want (thought they were not noticeable on my face, I saw them on my forearms, where I had checked the color.) And not anywhere near enough coverage for my blotchy spots. And considering how thin the product is, it did stick on dry areas more than expected--but not more so than some (especially drugstore) foundations.

The color 20W was nice for my fair, but not pale, neutral (but on the cool side) coloring.

About the scent, it seemed off--or something. Don't know why that is, but I was a little concerned.

Will be returning. Still, I can see that this may be a great foundation for other skin and age types, and maybe the off-smell was a fluke for this particular order.",original

"Office 2013 has the annoying requirement that one must have a Microsoft Account to install it. This feels like an intrusion. The lack of a CD version is an alarming omission. Many other reviews have mentioned licensing to one system which finally got changed somewhat. All these things make purchasing office less attractive and subscribing to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Office-365/dp/B00DG6IW3M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Office 365</a>&nbsp;more so by comparison.

I feel this is the a strategy to migrate Microsoft's purchased software model to a subscription only model. That way we subscribe and effectively purchase a new copy every 2 years or less via the monthly subscription charges.

The product itself is a continuation of the MS strategy toward touch and tablet oriented interfaces which started with the ""ribbon"" in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Office-2007/dp/B000HCXKKS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Office 2007</a>, continued in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Office-2010/dp/B0036Z0NZI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Office 2010</a>&nbsp;and now is further along with office 2013. For me the ribbon takes up more screen space leaving less for my documents and is a ""busy"" interface compared to menus making it more difficult to find what I want among the clutter. I don't care so much for the ribbon but I have come to peace with it.

As for getting things done - word, excel, outlook, powerpoint, etc. all work and accomplish their tasks. It's not a lot better than office 2007 or later. Building a new system I'd get office 2013, but I would not bother upgrading.

A particular point of trouble is Outlook. Each version of outlook and even patches break our some 3rd party plugins and connectors. This is very annoying and we hate this. While it may not be the actual case it feels like a MS strategy to make exchange look better than some very good 3rd party groupware while pretending to be open.

I've tried alternatives like open office or wordperfect and still always come back to office which is entrenched so deeply in the marketplace. Like an annoying habit I'm stuck with MS office and it does get the job done so 2 stars - it almost okay I guess.",original

"I bought this software with two goals:

1. Have it import all my stock trading information to prevent hours of data entry.
2. eFile my return to get my rebate ASAP, so I could pay off some credit cards and avoid paying interest.

Unfortunately, TurboTax failed at both those tasks.

When first importing stock trading information from my online brokerage, it didn't calculate the cost basis, which meant that TurboTax literally tried to add $20,000 in taxes for what should have been a tax deduction because of a net loss.

I realized the error (things like that tend to *ahem* get my attention) and was able to research and enter the correct data after a few hours of work, but I'm disappointed because the avoidance of labor was one of the things I thought I paid for when I bought the ""Premier"" edition.

To make matters worse, TurboTax won't let me eFile! When I got to the end of my return, TurboTax told me that because I filled out part of a Schedule H (nanny tax) form, eFile isn't allowed because of what they said was ""IRS Regulation"".

Leary of the error message, I researched the matter and discovered the only time when both the IRS and Intuit's TurboTax site mention the form in question is to say it's supported for eFiling! I called support about it, and they saw no reason why an eFile shouldn't be allowed, so I'm assuming the problem is another bug.

What frustrates me the most about that is, 1. I paid for the eFile as part of the purchase price of the software and 2. since I want to pay off credit cards with my tax refund, the extra weeks required for paper mailing vs. eFiling mean more interest payments for me!

Also worth noting is that support calls require long hold times, and all the undertrained support reps do is search their website for help files, so they don't do anything you can't do yourself and they aren't especially helpful (especially on the day when the TurboTax website crashed and they had no other resource to fall back on).

The one thing I'll say about TurboTax is at least it beats researching and filling out paper returns by hand, and it imported last year's tax return information from an old TurboTax file.

The bottom line is that I expected more, and am ultimately disappointed, but it did at least save a little work over trying to figure all the forms out myself. If I had to do it over again, I'd probably go with H&R Block TaxCut instead.

UPDATE: After some waiting and heavy Googling, I discovered the reason I couldn't eFile was because I didn't check a box that said I paid my nanny's state unemployment tax by April 15, 2009.

I contacted online chat that told me it should just install.  They advised me to call Applecare between 9am and 5pm (I work during the day - duh).  I guess the chat people don't have the authority to fix

"That is a direct quote from the FTM knowledge base AnswerID 1403.

Even more frustrating, printing 8.5 inch x 10 foot charts did work well using my desktop Epson Photo R800 printer with FTM 2011, but ceased working when I upgraded to FTM 2012. In FTM 2011, Page Setup in the Chart Options box correctly read the user defined page size settings entered via Windows and the usual Epson interface. FTM 2012 ignores those settings and defaults to 8-1/2 x 11 even when roll is specified as the printer source.

So I'm uninstalling FTM 2012 and going back to FTM 2011.

By the way, I upgraded mainly to get the new Print Box on chart feature. Let's just say its capabilities are modest compared to similar features in other software. You can specify font, outline box, etc. only once, so there can be no variety in text added to a chart.

And FTM 2012 is definitely slower than FTM 2011 as many have noted.",original

"I gave it a middle-of-the road rating at this point because it turns out the version I bought is a ""hybrid"" version, which I didn't know at that the time of purchase.  The disk is a genuine Microsoft disk.  I called Microsoft tech support and asked what is a ""hybrid.""  Below is a link to what the Professional 2007 hybrid was.  Tech Support said ""hybrid"" was a download and not a disk.  It did activate and I do have a product key.  The Tech thought I may be okay. Until the program started to reinstall every time I opened it, I had no idea that this was a hybrid version and the sealed package doesn't disclose this fact.  I fixed the reinstall problem by entering ""regedit"" in the search box (under the start button in Windows 7), right clicked to run it as Administrator, under HKEY_Current_User, Software,Microsoft, Office, 12.0, then clicked on the individual programs (e.g., Word), right clicked in the blank area to the right for ""new"", then selected DWord, renamed it ""NoReReg"", then modified the value from ""0"" to ""1"".  This took care of the Windows Installer trying to reinstall these programs every time I started using them for that day.  Now I have my fingers crossed that all is well with this Microsoft Office Professional 2007 Full Version.  Most of the businesses in our area still use 2007 and 2010, so I wanted to learn those systems; otherwise, if it were just for my personal and home business use, I'd probably go with 2013 or 365.  Buying older software from resellers is still a risky business.  Hope this info helps.  UPDATE:  My seller hadn't heard of a ""hybrid"" version either but he offered to refund my money.  So far, it's working.  I set the computer clock ahead 90 days to see if I could trigger it to stop working but the program continued to work.  I decided to keep it because I do need to become proficient in this Office Suite if I want to remain marketable in my area.

"I was playing around in the demo version of iWork09, and it seemed ok and according to the glowing reviews I ordered it. Mistake. Once I got into the pages program I stated to notice being told in apple support that ""No, Pages won't do that"". And I will list just a few things that pages does not do that Word for Mac does. I want the program to display full screen, cant do that, you have to drag and re-size the window each time, I want to set up my own labels, can't do that. I want a document that has both then envelope and letter in the same documents, can't change sections within a document. I wanted to set up my own format to display the date in a document, can't do that, you can in a table but not in a letter. You can edit the date but it gives you the same four 00/00/0000 format, or you can change the date to the time or change the date to the same date format plus add the time, who does that in a letter. Can not mix landscape and portrait pages in the same document. [...]  This is all fine for a letter to grandma, but anything complex, or even a little complex, it is useless.

Numbers is not as bad, so far, but I have not spent much time on it. I don't like the way it displays spreadsheets, I want a full page display. Not little groups of spreadsheets scattered around the desktop.

One telling problem with both these programs is looking in the preferences controls. There are almost none when compared to Word or Excel. As much as I hate Mircosoft and would have liked to migrate to an Apple product, iWork09 is not that product.",original

"I've been a strong Microsoft supporter for decades. When Windows 7 was out, I bought more than six copies to upgrade every single computer I had access to.

Fast forward to November 2012, I ran out of Windows 7 boxes so I had to buy a new one. Windows 8 was already out so why not getting the ""latest and greatest""? BIG mistake.

I'm trying to like it, but I can't, I just can't.

If a veteran Windows user has to open google and search for ""How to access control panel in Windows 8"" then you're doing something SERIOUSLY wrong.

I'm sorry, but GUIs are supposed to be intuitive! Another example: how are you supposed to guess the ""hot corners"" without doing some research or somebody telling you?

Trust me, as soon as you start using Windows 8 you'll find yourself in situations where you want to go back and there's no back button, you'll want to close something and there'll be no ""close"" button, you'll want to configure an application and there'll be no menu or ""settings"" button.

Yeah I get it! it's the whole Metro/Tablet thing, right? I'm sorry but my main computer at work is not a tablet, it's a workstation and I deserve a real OS, not something that resembles my phone or some kind of kindergarten software.

Anyway, I've been flirting with the idea of getting a MacBook Pro for a long time, well, Windows 8 gave the little push I was missing. I just bought one and I'm in love with i (I can run my Windows software using Parallels).

"I bought this because my brother, who by his own admission is neither a good speller nor typist, recommended it so highly. The reason we got talking about it was that I was curious about some of the errors in his emails, which it turned out he was dictating. Since I am working on several novels and am always open to the help technology can give, I reasonably thought it might be a real boon.

But it is more trouble than it is worth. Not only does it lag behind my not-particularly-fast speech, but it makes grievous errors. I am trained as a radio announcer so am quite precise with p, t and other sometimes-elided consonants and have standard American English, I believe without regional inflection. So the software's inability to decode my speech accurately seems unreasonable. I used it for quite a while and went through many, many hours of training on it, but still I was spending more time correcting its errors than it would take me to type out a tract from the beginning. And of course sometimes I was missing its errors which horrified my editor soul.

Then came Dragon's invasive advertising, not just emails, but popup windows which I thought I had disabled on this computer. Even worse, something kept popping up that claimed I had not registered my copy when in fact I had. It comes with two copies. I wonder whether it wanted me to register both copies so if I switched computers, I'd have to buy anew?

I believe I'll follow another reviewer's suggestion to try Windows' speech recognition software. At any rate, my advice is to steer clear of this.",original

"I'm not sure I like the taste of this toothpaste.  It has a strange aftertaste that puts me off.  It tastes great at first but the longer I brush, the less I like this strange taste.  I wasn't sure what jasmine, which is a flower, would taste like but I knew that there is such a thing as jasmine tea and that it's quite popular.  Most conventional toothpastes are too strong for me.  And I'm not really a fan of strong mint.  But I'm not sure I like the flowery taste of this Marvis flavor.  I tried the Ginger Mint flavor but it's way too strong and makes my eyes water.  I don't think there's such a thing as unflavored toothpaste but I'm going to search for it anyway.  I would rather have something fruity, like orange.  Tom's used to make an orange flavor that was available at the drugstore but I haven't seen it around for years.  That one was great for me because it didn't have much mint.  I will use this Marvis Jasmine toothpaste up because it was so expensive, however, I will continue to look for something without mint and something that doesn't taste like a mouthful of flowers.  I find the jasmine taste very unpleasant and absolutely dread using it.  But for the price, I will have to bite the bullet and suck it up like a big girl and manage to use the full tube, even if it takes me a while.  I don't put much on the brush because I'm not a fan of the taste.  If I get a cavity, it's solely the fault of this strange tasting toothpaste.  I guess if you like jasmine tea, you might like this flavor.  But the attraction of flowery toothpaste is totally lost on me.  In a word: Yuck!",original

"I have used previous versions of Kaspersky with great success. This version is toatlly different from past versions. It is complicated to find and figure out ANY settings. They went to a new format for setting things up, everything is now in a hidden file, different page, obscure setting with abstract abbreviations, technical descriptions and many unknown features and what they do or how to set them.
I had it installed for about 4 months, downloaded a malware, the malware destroyed all the settings in Kaspersky, It infected my computer, I had to use Malwarebytes to rid it of these maladies. While the malware was removed, it left crumbs everywhere, my computer was starting while it was in sleep or hibernate, would start programs without being seen while I had it on, Kaspersky sat idly by and did nothing. As I got into the program, I found that Kaspersky was reset to allow incoming traffic. There was no warning, it just let it come in.

"Don't buy it. You will be sorry if you have to reformat your drive or re-install the operating system. You can't re-install Kaspersky a second time. so you just flushed the price of this questionable program. I had the program installed for 3 days. Due to a virus (that Kaspersky missed) I had to reload the OS (windows 8.1) to the factory settings. Which of course erases all the installed programs. So now I try to re-install Kaspersky. Nope, cannot be done. And search their web site, trouble shooting, forum and support,...nothing.  It will not activate with the original activation code supplied.
Well, you can still get some use out of the disk. It makes an excellent $40.00 Frisbee for your dog to chase around. Especially one that has the habit of eating poop.",original

"First and foremost this DOES NOT allow a upgrade from Windows 7.  It does allow you to keep all your data but does wipe out your applications so if there is a program you can't live without and can't find the original disks you have a BIG decision to make.  I would suggest you put all self generated files, e.g., documents on an external drive and then disconnect the drive just in case.

Shortly after the installation the OS did a critical update so when I came back to my computer it was done.  Note:  I did an 8.0 to  8.1 upgrade on my Surface pro the day before as a downloaded upgrade.  The results were not stellar to say the least.  On the tablet I had to remove the update because it wiped out the wifi connection and I tried everything I knew to restore it.  Once I backed off the update it worked just fine.  On the desktop (New Dell that came native with 8 on it) I began getting error messages saying that my IE browser was an old version of Netscape and it was incompatible.  The solution I found was to install the newest version of Fire Fox which seems to fixed the problem.  It appears that some vendors are not as compatible as they thought they were and MS has some work to do.

So In my estimation 8.1:
1.  Has some bugs that need to be addressed
2.  Is faster than 7 was
3.  Has a smaller learning curve
4.  Has some compatibility issues
5.  Needs to allow drive indexing for external drives to speed up the seek time
5. Needs MS attention to fix the glitches pronto if they want to gain in their market share.",original

"I am 41 years old with fair/medium skin tone.  I bought this product after watching a demonstration on one of the Home Shopping networks.  I have never used Laura Geller products before, but the demo on TV was so impressive, I figured, why not?

This is a compact powder that is a mix of different colors.  You use a small compact brush (it does not come with this product - you have to order it separately) in order to apply it.  The intention is that you can use this by itself (instead of foundation).  Or, you can use it on top of your foundation to ""set it"" to last longer.

I tried to use it both ways, and found that the coverage is average - it's heavier than most of the pressed powder that I have tried in the past.  But, I can still see my freckles through it.  The heavier that you apply it, the more ""cakey"" it looks so you can't get more coverage that way.  As far as how long it lasts, it lasted about 3 hours which is average for any other kind of powder that I have tried.

As far as the color, I agree with one of the other reviewers that it is darker than you might expect for a ""Fair"" color - it's closer to what I would describe as Medium color.

In summary, I can't say that it's worth the extra cost and do not plan to purchase it again.",original

If I hadn't purchased the retail box, I would have easily assumed this was a beta alpha release. It wasn't in any way, shape or form, ready for end-user consumption. The most simple task of writing multi session data CD-RW's is appalling.

It has been suggested on several forums that a major new update to Nero 9 is due in October. Nero needs to due something quickly as it has already alienated a large portion of its customer base. Installation time is horrid, it's bloated, buggy, and in desperate need of serious overhaul.",original

"I bought MacDictate after reading the many glowing reviews, especially from freelance writers like myself. After reading about the less than stellar quality headphones that come with the software, I decided to buy a Logitech model. The software came. It installed without any problems. I decided to use the headphones that came with the software to see if the reviews were right. Guess what. They were.

The next time I launched MacDictate, I set up a new profile with the Logitech headphones. Unlike the first session, the software picked up every word that I spoke. I blew through the training modules and was dictating my article within five minutes. What a huge difference from that first night! The software isn't perfect. Neither is the user.

For some reason, when I say ""paragraph"" the software doesn't start a new paragraph. Accuracy is about 80 to 85%, which isn't too bad for a first serious run. I will have to go back to the training section until I can iron out the problems. Despite the quirks and hiccups, I am happy with my purchase. I think that in a month or two, I will save a lot of time by not having to type out everything. I am not a slow typist, but I tend to self-edit as I write, which makes me a slow writer.

Let the Buyer Beware! The H&R Block Tax Cut Program seems to have a mind of it's own sometimes and I don't think the program is geared toward handling all comers the way it should be.

I had to go back three times on routine checks to correct items checked (like the allowance blocks to ID age and disability status) because the program had 'assumed' my answers and answered for me incorrectly.

If you're used to other online products that sync to the desktop (think Dropbox & Google Drive as two very popular examples, there are many others), you will find this clunky & old-tech.  Everytime you open Quicken, it will tell you you made changes, whether you did or not, and suggest that you sync.  This should be an automated, behind the scenes process, it's not hard.
3.  The alerts are rather dumb, and they're essentially hard-coded.  You can't create your own rules, and you can't even do a lot with the built-in rules (you can just pick some parameters from a limited list).  You can't delete them all either, if you consider them dumb and pointless.  Again, not hard to do a lot better.

There are no significant improvements in reporting, or in investment analysis.  If you look at the ""What's new in 2013"" page, you see mobile, alerts, and ""more flexible budgeting"", whatever that means.

There is a tweak to how accounts show up in the nav bar, where you can put some accounts in the ""Separate"" list, which means ""show but don't include with main set of accounts"".  This is mildly useful.  There's also a feature to mark an account ""closed"", also slightly useful -- in theory.  These account still show up in the list of accounts when you're doing a transfer between investment accounts!  Clearly someone forgot what the word ""closed"" might mean.

So all in all, same old Intuit, same old Quicken.  Buy it if the mobile feature is useful to you.  (BTW, I tried Mint as an alternative, and I couldn't stand the heavy-duty selling on every darned screen.  Maybe some people can tune this stuff out, I couldn't.)",original

"For anyone thinking of getting Kaspersky Internet security, I would recommend getting Norton 360 instead.  I've used this software for a year now and it's given me nothing but problems.  Like any program, it sits on the system tray and monitors computer activity.  The biggest problem is during start-up.  It doesn't start-up.  Even though your network is active, it won't let you use the internet until the tray icon starts.  That often forces me to reboot and waste another 7 minutes.  I know it's not my computer because it's even worse on my laptop.  There have been times that I had to boot into Linux because I wasted more than an hour restarting over and over.  Both my laptop and desktop have 4 gigs of memory a piece, which should be more than enough to run a security program.  The moment I de-installed it and put in Norton 360, the problems completely went away.  This is a direct result of poor programming.

About security...what security??  This software has caught a total of zero viruses.  I have had my browsers hijacked more times than I can count.  The free stuff usually finds and deletes them.

"Let me explain what I mean.

I haven't used Quicken or any money management software sine the early days of Apple - Back when they were referred to as ""Macintoshes"" and were twice the price they are now.  Of course, they actually cost that amount to manufacture, unlike now.  But I digress.

Anyway, I've never used Microsoft Money or any other, so my review isn't skewed by a transition from one software to another, only the need to start organizing my various finances.  I already have a pretty good handle on things, but what I really needed was a birds-eye view of all of my due dates for my accounts in one interface.  I could always log them into Outlook tasks, but then I don't get the benefit of amounts that need to be paid, so I can plan in advance.

I could have used one of the various online management tools, but I have issues giving my bank account info to some online site especially if they don't give guarantees against security breaches that cost me money.  In any event, the offline app works better as I don't have to deal with timeouts and the like.  Unfortunately, Quicken Premier is absolutely NOT the application for me.  There are so many issues with the application that I don't really know where to start.  I will do my best to cover everything, and I will only focus on the negatives, because I think the positives would apply to any application, not just Quicken.

** What Quicken Premier Does WRONG **

- Most notable, Quicken Premier tries to help you by ""memorizing"" certain things.  You might consider this a benefit.  The problem is when it tries to memorize a replacement for a generic item.  For example, if you link your checking account and you have line items that say ""Debit Purchase"", for varying amounts, you obviously want to better categorize that name.  So you pick some transactions that are under $10 and assume they must be food.  You find those items and update the Category to Dining.  Now, I as a human being would expect such memorization to apply ONLY to the account I selected, NOT EVERY ACCOUNT.  Additionally, I would expect the software to be smart enough to realize that I did a search based on the dollar amount, so even if you apply it going forward, the same rule should apply (transactions less than $10 only).  That's not what Quicken does.  It just looks for any ""Debit Purchase"" and renames it, even if it didn't match your initial search criteria.  Why they would have this glaring oversight is beyond me.

- Second, Quicken is quite stupid when it comes to categorizing accounts.  I have four accounts at a particular bank, three checking and one credit line.  Quicken picked up my main checking and my outflow account with little issue, but it logged the inflow account (checking) as a credit card.  It logged my credit line as a checking account.  Even though my credit line is called ""LINE OF CREDIT"".  Yeah, okay.  Incidentally, the inflow account listed payments as charges and charges as payments (a whole other issue, BTW).  What a nightmare.

- Third, Quicken allows you to create linked transactions between disparate accounts.  This is all well and good, except it's not smart enough to go out and simply find the opposite transaction on its own.  What it does instead is add another line item for the opposite transaction, skewing your balance sheet.  So for example, of my accounts listed above, I have a somewhat linear transfer path: inflow to primary, primary to outflow, primary to line of credit, line of credit to primary.  I see a debit transaction in the inflow that is definitely an instance where I transferred funds to the primary account.  So I set the category as a transfer, and note the account it went to.  I would expect Quicken to go out, search for an identical, opposite amount transaction in the linked account, and simply create the bond, because obviously if I transferred money from account A to account B, I should have an inbound credit in account B.  That's logical right?  It doesn't do that.  Instead, it creates a duplicate line item.  So when I went through and added transfer categories on my accounts, it screwed all of my balance sheets up to heights you wouldn't believe.

- Fourth, Quicken does not allow you to set the method of reconciliation or download.  Meaning, I don't want to manually edit transactions in my checking accounts or my line of credit; that's why I linked it to the banks in the first place.  I want Quicken to use the bank's response file as the be-all-end-all source of correct information.  I don't want it to accept any manual changes to any amounts or transactions, because obviously the bank record is correct.  Unfortunately, once you download the transactions the first time, Quicken is more than content to allow you to modify the line items, which is fine...but I'd like an option to disable this.

- Fifth, Quicken apparently has no way to link out and just grab ADP or Paychex data from the databases, even though both have the capability of feeding this data (since various tax programs can do it, including I believe Intuit's own TurboTax Deluxe).  Filling in payroll information is corny, do you know why?  My check is never the same.  I might have overtime, I might have sick time, I might have a bonus, I might have extra fees, my medical might have gone up or down, I might have worked less hours, etc.  It's not a valid thing to have to do.

- Sixth, and speaking of payroll, Quicken does not allow you to distinguish percentage-calculated amounts versus fixed amounts.  In other words, we know that a person is charged federal tax at a percentage, referred to as a tax bracket.  That means it needs to be calculated based on the amount of reported income on the check.  Quicken does not allow you to set a percentage...you have to enter a fixed amount, which won't apply if your check changes.  I have no idea why this is, considering, again, TurboTax Deluxe has no problem with this.  In fact, TurboTax will even calculate what your bracket is and calculate the correct tax based on your total YTD.  Why does Quicken Premier lack this functionality, given its primary selling point is the ability to help you plan for tax time?  Yes, I know, two different programs for two different purposes.  But financial planning includes the ability to manage exactly how much tax you're paying and expected to pay.

- Seventh, Quicken will not pull ""today"" data, even if said data was entered the day prior.  So for example, my bank is on the east coast and works on that time.  If I enter a transaction after 9pm my time, it gets credited to the next business day in my transactions.  That's fine, but it wreaks havoc in Quicken, because Quicken will not show those transactions, yet it will pull the actual total balance as if the transactions were there.  One or the other, Intuit - either you credit ALL transactions regardless of date, as they show in my web account, and show the correct balance, or you reflect the balance and transactions as they stood the day prior.  Now maybe my bank is part to blame for that with their file exports.  But I still lay blame on Quicken for not hashing this out with banks in different time zones.

Some other things I note:

- The interface is dog ugly.  It's a giant spreadsheet, essentially.  I seem to remember it always being like this, but I would have hoped that it would have been improved by now.

- You can't sort by downloaded vs. non-downloaded transactions.  Otherwise I could have cleared out the junk it put in there on its own and been left with the downloaded transactions which I know to be correct.

- No built-in Bill Pay.  Instead, you are directed to sign up for a $10/month subscription to do this.  Now maybe this Bill Pay is the greatest thing since sliced bread and I just don't know what I'm missing.  But my bank already affords me the ability to do bill pay, faster, and free.  Therefore, I see no value in doing this except the remote possibility they have electronic payments for accounts that my bank doesn't - something I would not pay money for.

- No ability to pull bill data from utilities.  Wells Fargo's Online service has this ability, so I know it's possible.  Maybe they did something specific over there, but I'm quite shocked that Quicken is not on the ball here.

- No ability to just delete everything and tell it to re-download from scratch.  No idea why this is missing.

Can I recommend it?  No.  It's trying too hard to make things easy.  When you just want accuracy, this tool fails horribly.  As a manual management tool, it probably would shine, but in that case you could fire up Excel, download a template and get it done much faster.  For the price this is being offered at, I simply cannot recommend buying it.  Also, if you do end up buying it, I strongly recommend you opt for the physical copy rather than the digital download.  Physical copy has Amazon's return policy plus Intuit's satisfaction guarantee beyond the 30 day from Amazon.  Digital copy has NO return capability no matter what.

"This is my fifth year using Quicken TurboTax and it will be my third year using the state tax version. I'm sold on it. I can't imagine going back to pen and paper to do taxes. The program takes you step-by-step through the tax process by asking you questions about the various sections of the forms. It also prompts you to make you remember about things that may have slipped you mind, like other deductions. And, it makes suggestions for deductions that you may not have thought about. At the end of the process you can print out the forms for mailing in the traditional format or in a format that's easy for the IRS computers to read. In addition, you can opt to file electronicly. The help section IS very helpful. It actually makes sense of the rules and instructions for filing your taxes and explains the relevant sections of the tax code in easy to understand language. My one suggestion is that you have all your papers with you before you start the process. You can, of course, save your work and come back to finish or edit it, but it is a pain to be half way through and remember that your mortgage statement is two floors away.
I'm giving it three stars instead of five because of the product activation. Bad job Intuit. However, the activation doesn't prevent you from installing on more than one computer but it does prevent you from printing or electronically filing from the second computer. Still, you can take your saved file from work or where ever and bring it home to print or file.
I tried Taxcut this year because of the product activation on TurboTax. I had problems with it right off. It stated on the box that you could import TurboTax files but when I tried it wouldn't let me. The Taxcut web site suggested that this was a common problem and that you had to edit your TurboTax file (with TurboTax) to bring it down to a certain size. Still, it didn't tell you what that size was ok or really give you any idea on what to cut out. (I thought all of the our tax info was important).
My advice: The activation stinks but TurboTax is still the best tax prep software.",original

"I purchased another TurboTax&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TurboTax-Deluxe-Federal-State-eFile-2008/dp/B001GL6QHS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TurboTax Deluxe Federal + State + eFile 2008</a>&nbsp;from Amazon for $49.99 with five free federal e-filings and FREE state download (only one state downloaded free, 2nd different state download cost $$).  You still have to pay $19.99 per state tax return you e-file.  When I finished my sixth tax return (I was wrong and thought it offered six free federal e-filings), I went through the process, paid the state e-filing fee only to be informed that I had reached the limit.  TurboTax downloaded another one for me, but I couldn't transfer the tax data I had already filled out, and I couldn't import it to their online returns since it was 2008 data.  TurboTax said I would have to buy another version and do the sixth tax return all over on another computer.  I couldn't use my free MD state download or my paid Missouri state download since I had to do it on another computer.

So I purchased this one just to do one tax return and discovered that downloading one state cost $39.99.  Since I had already printed out the Missouri state return from my computer, I skimped and only downloaded MD state return and will paper file the Missouri one.  I still had one unused state e-filing on my previous TurboTax but was told that the two go hand in hand, so you have to e-file the same federal & state, you can't use an unfiled state e-file on another return.

Bottom line is that original version I purchased (see above link) with the free state is now around $41.  This one cost $34.39 + $39.99 for one state = $74.38.  Crazy prices - I wish I had purchased the $41 w/free state download and saved myself some bucks!

Also, since there are five people in my home (only 2 returns as yet though) and friends asked me to do their return, TurboTax should have flexibility so that if you exceed the five limit, you can reload more and not have to pay all over again for another software package, another 2nd state download etc.  I am going to suggest this to them for next year.",original

My McAfee 2013 ran for an entire year, and now this 2014 update needs to remove Norton residual components?

20 minutes wasted.  Then I contacted McAfee, who wasted another 25 minutes before their asking for a fee for removing Norton.  Huh?  I thought this issue was resolved in 2013.  Furthermore, I expected McAfee would just advise me how to remove Norton, if not remove it for me.

"Intuit is a despicable company now. This is the same that company came out with really functional and reasonably priced products in early 1990's like Quicken, Quickbooks & Turbotax.

But somewhere in late 1990's this company was taken over by the same crooks who run the Wall Street. Instead of attracting users to upgrade to their product's new versions by improving them, like Apple does, the nitwits at Intuit blackmail you to upgrade to newer versions of Intuit products by taking away the functionality of earlier versions. For example they are blackmailing users into upgrading to Quicken 2009 by dropping support for online banking in earlier versions; and to Quickbooks 2009 by dropping support for payroll in earlier versions.

Now Intuit's motto is to gouge the customers as much as they can by hook or crook (mostly) by extorting them to upgrade to a poorly functional and buggy newer version.

1. They are forcing Quicken users to upgrade to 2009 version by blackmailing them: dropping support for online banking in earlier versions.

2. The newer version, Quicken 2009, is poorly functioning & buggy (as detailed by other reviewers too), not a better product. The program shuts down every time I try to accept an individual downloaded transaction. The only way to stop that is to click on ""Accept all""

2. Periodically the programs refuses to read the file and I have to restore the backup file. I used to backup once a month with earlier versions and now I do it every time I exit the program.

4. Online support to download transactions is also limited: for example I cannot download transactions for my credit card from Charles Schwab Bank.

5. After the upgrade they provide very limited technical support. For all practical purposes there is no technical support. They do not even provide a tech support phone number to call. You can contact them from the web site when they provide you with a useless ticket number. Instead they direct to Quicken User Communities. After taking your money, they want other users of Quickbooks to provide you with technical support!

6. So Intuit got your money, you got a buggy software with poor functionality, and no technical support. You cannot even do now what you were able to do in an earlier version. You paid money to go from a functioning product to a buggy software.

What a trade off! Basically Intuit screwed you.

Purchasing Quicken is, of course, just the beginning of the upgrade ordeal. Real nightmare starts when you start getting all those error messages. After you install Quicken 2009, you will find that it has become cluttered with useless features that you do not even need. At the end you are left with the feeling: Intuit has screwed me.

Every time you deal with Intuit, you will be left with a bad taste and hate for this company. Not only they blackmail you into upgrading, every time you have to pay the full price of newer version, there is no upgrade price. And you can get Quicken cheaper at Amazon than buying from Intuit directly.

I hate dealing with Intuit and dumped their Turbotax for Taxact in 2004 and was planning to dump Quicken for Mint. And now they have purchased Mint! What are the alternatives to Quicken? Please leave your response in the comments section and help us dump Quicken.",original

"I've used Turbo Tax for years and thought that my tax returns were being prepared correctly until I ran into a problem this year.  The problem revolves around an incorrect error message this year in Turbo Tax regarding HSA (Health Savings accounts)  After looking through all of the help topics on the Turbo Tax ""Live Community"" site,  I found a ""work around"" under this title, ""HSA ""Failure to Maintain HDHP Coverage"" Displays When Not Applicable"" that didn't work.  Not only that, but I would have been submitting false information on my tax return had I used it.  They stated in one post that the update in Feb. fixed the problem.  Since I used the software in April it obviously didn't.

So I called Turblo Tax after hunting all over the place for a number. I sat on hold for 35 minutes and then after being connected to someone on their help desk and explaining my problem sat on hold for another 40 minutes before being disconnected.

Update 4/15/12 - I finally posted the question about the error message on an Amazon discussion thread where Bob Meighan with TurboTax was posting answers to other comments and questions.  He posted a link (the one I had already found that didn't work) and also posted a link to his email.  My emailed questions were answered promptly and finally ended up with him phoning and I thought the problem was resolved but then found out after reviewing the filled out forms that it still wasn't right.

The error message wasted a lot of my time which I don't think I should have had to spend.  And my tax forms weren't filled out correctly in the end.

"Here are some answers to questions that I think people might have:

Who can use Snow Leopard?
This is only for the new Intel Macs. You can install Snow Leopard if you have iMac made on or after January 6, 2006, Mac Minis starting Feb. 28, 2006, any Mac Pro, any MacBook or any MacBook Pro. Also note that you need at least 1 GB of RAM. Some older Mac Minis may not have enough memory.

Who can't use Snow Leopard?
You CANNOT install Snow Leopard if you have an iBook or PowerBook (check the text below the screen), a PowerMac, an iMac that was made before 2006, or a Mac Mini made before Feb. 28, 2006.

What are the most likely problems?
For most casual users, the most likely problem is that your printer or scanner won't work because the drivers are out of date. UPDATE: Apple has released updates that resolve a lot of printer problems for people with HP, Canon, and Brother printers. I have a Dell 1720dn printer that won't install drivers, but I found that the Lexmark printer drivers would for the Dell.

Is Snow Leopard buggy?
Yes, there are glitches and little annoyances. Unless you're a power user, you may not notice these bugs. The vast majority of problems are caused by third-party incompatibilities with add-ons and extensions. Also, Apple releases over-the-internet updates to address bugs, so you can install it now and by default the computer will notify you when it is ready to update itself. At that point, it downloads the updater from the internet and installs itself.

How compatible is the software?
All of Apple's newest software (Safari web browser, iTunes, iCal, Preview PDF viewer, Mail email program, and so on) works fine. Microsoft Office 2008 programs (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Entourage) all work fine. The latest Adobe programs (Photoshop, Illustrator, Dreamweaver, Fireworks, InDesign, etc) work well with a few issues, with the possible exception of some problems with Adobe PhotoShop Elements 6. Most people don't use much more than these programs, so they'll be fine; however, there are some other programs with problems, and a very good list can be found at the macintouch website.

What does 64-bit, Grand Central, and OpenCL mean?
Technically they means a bunch of things. To most users the net result is that a lot of the Apple programs and the Finder (some people call it the Desktop) are somewhat to a lot faster. It really won't affect other programs until they are rewritten for Snow Leopard (you can see the macworld website for speed tests).

What other changes will I notice?
There are a lot of little things that are made easy or faster to do, but you won't notice them until you've used the system for a while. The more you use your computer, the more you'll notice. I've noticed that they've fixed a lot of little things that would sometimes annoy me.

Why is Apple selling an operating system without a lot of new features?
Apple's Leopard operating system already had a lot of features, and Apple decided to improve and speed up what they already have. After the initial bugs are worked out, Snow Leopard is going to be the easiest, most pleasant operating system to date. Apple has also built a lot of code that software developers can use to speed up computers in the future, so programs on Snow Leopard are likely to get FASTER with newer versions instead of slower like is so often the case. These technical improvements were a major undertaking, and Apple took a risk by spending the bulk of their time on improvements will make future Mac software much faster rather than on end-user features we can immediately see.",original

"Windows new GUI called Metro is a HORRID user interface for the desktop user.  Even worse, when you figure a way to get back to a normal desktop -- the type you have been trained to use now for over 20 years -- MS decides on some sneaky way to throw you right back into the clumsy Metro interface!  Indefensible, Microsoft.

If you thought Vista was bad, you'll find Windows 8 is much, much worse.  It's clear to me that MS did little to no desktop user experience testing before sending this piece of software ""krappola"" out the door to make bundles of licensing cash.  It also looks particularly sleazy of them to do this when you realize that modern, well designed OS interfaces like Linux Mint and the new Mac OSX ""Mavericks"" are totally free.  Microsoft tries to rob you of over $100 for this ugly OS ""upgrade"" version and up to $200 if you want to go for the ""full"" install of the ""Pro"" version.

And if the horrid Metro UI isn't enough to scare you away, please realize the if you buy the ""upgrade"" Win8 OS package because you already have XP/Vista/Win7 on your system but then decided (smartly) to do a clean install of Win8 (because the install DVD gives you this option), you'll soon find out that the activation key provided by Microsoft in the ""upgrade"" DVD package DOES NOT WORK!  Microsoft wants you to buy the ""full"" install DVD -- not the ""upgrade"" install DVD -- if you take the path of doing a clean install over your existing Windows system.  Unacceptable!

Why the executives at Microsoft haven't all been fired for this OS disaster is beyond me.  It's really is that bad.  In summary, if you like the idea of being forced at almost every turn to use a ham-fisted, clumsy ""XBox"" style visual interface to control your PC, then you'll love Windows 8.  Most desktop users will feel otherwise.  Save your money and wait for Microsoft to fix this incredible mess with Windows 9.  The fact the used copies of Windows 7 with valid product keys are now going for very high prices on EBay and at other retail sites should tell you something.",original

"Used TM for several years.  Since installing this version I experienced long boot times and disk churning.  Went so far as to replace the hard drive and reinstall windows 7.  Finally dug deeper and found ""coreservices.dll"" was using almost 100% of my CPU time.  Searched it and found it was Titanium's main/core background service.  Searched TM site and found two patches and neither fixed it.  Nuked Titanium and all is now well.  TM later got back to me for a round of ""blame the customer"" support. Been there, done that. Too late.  Plus they wanted to remotely logon to my PC from the Philippines to diagnose it.  NO WAY!

Now using BitDefender Family Pack.  Supports all my family and all our devices for $69.99/year.  That's two PC's, two notebooks, one tablet and two phones.  Best feature is that it is totally out of my face.  A truly silent sentry.  Can't believe I put up with TM's malware for so long.  I let a wolf into the hen house.  Stupid me.",original

"I know that most people must think they know what cystic acne is, but they really don't. I don't blame people, before when I got a larger ""normal"" zit, I thought it was a cyst, that is until I developed REAL cystic acne in my 20's. I have had the pimples that people are describing in their reviews and let me tell you, if you have ever had TRUE cystic acne this product will do nothing for you. For sufferers of real cystic acne you know what I am talking about--REAL cystic acne are nodules; hard, huge, sore lumps (not just big zits)that take months to go away. These nodules are so large and painful it's hard to move your face and are generally pea size or larger (I get ones that are larger than a lima bean). The cysts I get are so large and inflamed that I need to get cortisone injections just to bring the swelling down and relieve pain. A dermatologist will tell you there is nothing you can do topically for a real cyst, they need to be injected to bring down the swelling and from experience I can tell you this is true. I tried this as a last resort before Accutane, but I can tell you if you really truly suffer from cystic acne, this will do nothing for your nodules; large ""normal"" zits maybe, but not true cystic nodules.",original
"I got this hairbrush after years of lusting after it (yet not being able to justify to myself why one should spend so much on something like this). After seeing a recent onslaught of glowing comments about Mason Pearson products on sites like Into the Gloss, etc., I decided it would be worth the cost. I did select the kind that was designed for my hair type (long and fine, but lots of it). I am sorry to say that this hairbrush makes my hair all static-y and fluffy, and the bristles aren't long enough/straight enough to get all the way through my hair,so I would have to brush it in sections, which is kind of ludicrously time-consuming for so simple an act. However, the product is beautiful, as is the packaging, and it will look lovely lying around on my dressing table. Unless you're going for the status-symbolism element, I would say that, unfortunately, this item as a utilitarian product falls a bit short.",original

"I just installed 2014 as an upgrade from 2011.  THE ATTACHMENT ""VIEWER"" IS A *JOKE*!! On a 24 inch monitor it shows a picture of a check about ONE INCH hi by 2.5 INCHES WIDE! If I want to READ the contents I have to click on ""open"".  It then loads the item into my GRAPHICS EDITING PROGRAM!

A PDF of a receipt is WORSE! When I click on the paper clip to open the ""viewer"", it just shows me an Adobe Acrobat icon.  I then have to click on the icon and it opens in Acrobat.

And now I tried clicking on another check attachment and a SMALLER window popped up with a check image about THREE-QUARTERS OF AN INCH HI and 1.5 INCHES WIDE.

GUESS WHAT -- *I ALREADY KNOW IT'S A CHECK!!* How is THAT useful by ANY stretch of the imagination?

GET A CLUE, INTUIT!  Software is supposed to be USEFUL.  Users don't want to have to go through a whole series of clicks to do ANYTHING. And we don't want to have a FINANCIAL program sending things to all sorts of other programs.  A VIEWER should show a USEFUL VIEW.

UPDATE: I WOUND UP UNINSTALLING 2014 AND I REINSTALLED 2011.

UPDATE RE REINSTALLING 2011. Just a warning about THAT. For several months I continued using 2011 and it worked the same as always. Fortunately, I have two copies (same computer), one under Win 7 and one under Win 8 -- using the same data files. I have mainly been using Win 8. A recent auto software update on the Win 8 copy CHANGED HOW 2011 WORKS. Now, for PDF's, even 2011 automatically opens the system's default PDF viewer. It's definitely a software update because I tried the copy installed under Win 7 and that one doesn't do it.  (What I'll probably have to do is uninstall and reinstall the Win 8 copy and make sure I only run it off-line so it can't reinstall the update.) (Don't blame Win 8 or the ""Metro"" interface. Both Win versions are set up with Classic Shell menu, boot directly to the desktop and look and work almost identically.)

RE GOING BACK FROM 2014 TO 2011:

This is to clarify some reviews saying people who went from 2011 to 2014 can't go back.  IT DEPENDS. When I initially installed 2014, before doing that I made two complete copies of my data folder on a different hard disk as backups. To go back to 2011, I just renamed the folder that 2014 converted from ""Quicken"" to ""Quicken 2014"" and then copied one of the two backups and named that back to ""Quicken"". I reran the Quicken 2011 installer. Everything installed, and when I opened the program it even immediately found the data--it didn't even ask where it was located even though I don't store it in a default location. Although you can't CONVERT 2014 format to 2011 or open a 2014 data file with 2011, it is NOT true that once you install 2014 it is impossible to use 2011. Of course, if you ""jumped in"" and didn't bother making appropriate backups -- it's your own fault for being careless.

I only use Quicken to keep my checkbook and I download the QFX files and import them from my computer, so I probably really won't need to update.

TWO SUGGESTIONS FOR THE DEVELOPERS:

1) Put back a viewer like in 2011, at least as an option. People don't want either to see a microscopic image or having files open all over the place in a bunch of different programs. A file viewer that can display PDF's and the common image formats--GIF, PNG, JPG, TIFF--isn't that big a deal.

2) PLEASE change Find and Find and Replace to allow for TWO search parameters. For instance, for years I have paid one place $67 a week by check. It would be a HUGE timesaver to be able to put [Amount exactly 67.00] AND [Payee starts with ""Check""]. Instead, I have to search for ""Amount exactly 67.00"" and then scroll through HUNDREDS of entries where I already changed the Payee name.",original

"At the moment Vista Home Premium is running on my PC and several others in my family, all preinstalled by the manufacturer.  I pre-ordered Windows 7 Professional upgrades for each back when they were being offered for a big discount.  Today the W7 upgrades arrived and only then did I discover - as apparently many others have too - that ""upgrading"" from Vista Home Premium to W7 Pro actually requires a ""clean install"" instead of an in-place upgrade, necessitating a LOT of manual work to save the data from each, install W7, and then MANUALLY REINSTALL ALL APPLICATIONS as well as the data.  And for some bizarre reason known only to Microsoft, this rude surprise only applies to certain combinations of upgrades.

Printed on the box:
""This version of Windows 7 is designed as an upgrade to Windows Vista. If you are upgrading from Windows XP, you will need to back up your files and settings, perform a clean install, and then re-install your existing files, settings, and programs.""

OK, so they make it clear that you have your work cut out for you if you are upgrading from XP, but upgrading from Vista should be - well - an upgrade. But it is not, except for a few very specific versions of Vista.  See the Microsoft site for the few lucky cases.

This restriction makes no apparent sense, especially since I am upgrading to a ""better"" version of Windows, and I can find no explanation from Microsoft.  I find it most disheartening to say the least, because it will require hours and hours of work that I was not expecting - and that assumes that I can even find all of the install disks and downloads, plus be able to recreate all of the configurations and customizations.

I am reasonably computer literate so I expect that I will be able to get through this onerous task - eventually - but there is no way on this planet that my wife would be able to do this by herself, and she will not be alone.

Die-hard computer hobbyists who don't mind spending endless hours just tinkering with their computers to make them work to the pinnacle of perfection might find doing a clean install to their liking, but I do not.  I have a computer because it is a tool to accomplish work other than maintaining the tool itself.

I hope that some day the pain of my having to do multiple clean installs of W7 on my family's computers will all be the past, but for now it remains in the future, and I do not know for how long because I will only be able to do it when I have many hours available during which I have nothing else to do and during which time I can afford to have my computer down.  And of course, nothing will go wrong in the process.  Thank goodness cars don't work this way!

I am very, very disappointed in both Microsoft and Amazon for not mentioning this little detail amidst all of the glow about the benefits of W7, and I strongly recommend to those who are contemplating purchasing the W7 Professional ""Upgrade"" to now be aware of this inexplicable hole in the Windows upgrade matrix and seriously consider whether you have the knowledge, time and patience necessary to deal with this.

UPDATE:

I have now completed the ""clean install"" upgrades on several machines. The whole process works well and reliably - it just takes a long time (4+ hours including the time to save the original data to a USB drive and then restore afterwards).  The Easy Transfer utility provided by MS really works well and is the highlight of the process because it saves all of the user data and settings from the pre-Windows 7 machines and restores everything perfectly after the clean install of Windows 7.  Without this, the upgrade would have been much more work, and much riskier.  I have seen companies advertising migration products of their own, but you don't need them because MS's free utility does everything you need.

Now that the upgrade experience is behind me I am happy it is done, but I still stand by my original assessment, i.e. that this product is misleadingly labeled as a ""upgrade"" when that term only applies to the pricing and not the amount of work required to actually DO the upgrade in most cases.",original

"I've used Peter Norton programs since the days of CPM and found them to be simple, easy to use and well engineered.  However, this Ghost 12.0 program leaves a lot to be desired before it becomes User friendly.  I assume some outside software engineering company in China designed this program for them.

1.) The program is very slow to load.
2.) Instructions are very hard to follow and you don't get a manual.  The only manual that I could find on-line to print out, was for version 10.
3.) The program is a stand-along and does not intergrate into the System Works Program like their AntiVirus does.
4.) There is no sync feature.
5.) You can't rename your backup profiles without re-entering them.
6.) Their program rating form is joke.  Give them a sad smiling face (low-rating) and your not allowed to forward the survey...
7.) I backup to 2 external drives and I'm alway getting error messages.  One error message said that Norton didn't know what to do inorder to correct the program.

"Update 3: 06-04-2010  My xp machine at work was having problems and before I did anything, I UN-installed
PDF coverter pro 5. [as per Nuance instructions]

I ran a repair on windows and everything was running fine again.

I RE-installed pdf converter pro and crap!  When I went to activate, it said I had activated this copy of pdf converter pro 5 the maximum number of times....blah...blah....blah...

Here we go again.

Then it offered me a button to click on to BUY the program?????

I went over to ebay and picked up NITRO PDF 6, on a charity auction for like $40 (w/free S&H)

I tried a few pdf creations and a few pdf conversions with NITRO PDF 6 and so far it looks to work just as good, or better, than nuance's pdf product.

I'll contact Nuance about the problem by fax (can't seem to reach them any other way without PAYING for assistance. If their !#@!$$#@^%  product wasn't such a PITA, no one would have to contact them).

Needless to say, I downgraded this product's rating to a single star.

Update 2: 04-04-2010. Reinstallation of XP operating system CRIPPLED by nuance trying to revalidate license CONSTANTLY during the reinstall of XP.

My XP MCE 2005 operating system lost access to it's HAL.DLL file, requiring a reinstall of the OS.

This PITA pdf converter lost it's ability to validate it's license and CONSTANTLY preempted my
XP reinstall attempts.
Two attempts at removing the pdf converter still did not stop it from trying to validate it's license.
Even used JVPOWERTOOLS 2009, to remove EVERY registry entry for pdf converter AND nuance; still invaded my reinstall of XP.
It got so crippling that I simply used a new hard drive, initialized it and did a clean install of XP; then transferred data/user files afterward.

The validation process they use is a real PITA.

I'd gladly pay (...) or even (...) to just get a USB security dongle , so they can get rid of that
USELESS license verification process, built into their product.

Nuisance (oops, nuance) has NO fallback for those times you must do a clean install on your OS,
(AND are unable to access your OS in order to UNinstall their product ""Prior to"" the OS reinstall).

Nuance does things a lot different with their product's installation & activation.
A couple re-installs of your windows operating system due to windows issues; and/or a couple hardware upgrades like new video card or new hard drive, and PDF converter 5 could cease to function.

My installation had this problem recently.
At almost (...), you expect a program to function 24/7/365.
When mine stopped working, it really interrupted my work production.

So,
If you have this software installed and want to upgrade/changed ANY internal PC hardware, you MUST uninstall the pdf converter pro 5 software
""BEFORE you make ANY hardware changes"" !!!

NOTE: UNinstalling the program in effect ""DE-activates"" your pdf converter pro 5.
Thus ""releaseing"" the license key and this doesn't count against your
""5 license activations"", before product QUITS working!

I work with pc hardware and do pc repairs/upgrades 40+ hours a week.

On my work PC, I have upgraded my mobo 3 times this year. My hard drive twice.
(one of the perks of being the IT helpdesk guy) (last update was to an Intel i7 Core.)

Recently I had lost windows booting abilities, so I installed a newer, larger, hard drive.
So I installed the brand new hard drive and did a clean XP Pro installation.

As soon as I loaded PDF Converter 5 Pro, it wanted to activate.

Then it went online a few seconds and then an error window popped up saying I had exceeded the 5 activation allowances that Nuance allows.

I emailed Nuance the details.
I mentioned how I own 4 retail box copies of this s/w.

After going back and forth with support, they re-activated my license number.

But I could not make PDF files or about 2 days.

*****How to prevent this from happening again?****

If you are using PDF converter 5 on your PC, then ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS
do an UNinstall before changing ANY pc hardware.

The activation process takes serial numbers from the internal components and uses them for activation calculations. (probably the serial # of mobo and/or hard drives).

When a serial number changes due to new hardware, the s/w launches another activation attempt.
Five activations are allowed before the s/w is disabled.

You MUST UNistall the software before doing hardware upgrades, to keep the activation counter from decrementing one of the 5 activation allowances.

This is the sort of thing that should be listed on a neon colored label, on the CD's paper sleeve or jewel case. And/or on the box it comes in.
I told Nuance this, but I doubt they'll do anything about it.

Unforunately, it is not like there are a lot of choices for the
combination software of PDF maker with a PDF converters.

You have:
1. Nuance pdf conveter pro 5
2. Nitro pdf.
3. PDF tools [by solid documents]

Adobe's acrobat pdf maker is pricey and has no conversion abilities. It only creates PDFss.

Other single function s/w conveters are:

Able2extract
Docudesk
PDF conveter elite

Oh, and as far as product functionality, this software does okay.

PDF to word conversions do okay with text; but sort of crappy with images.
(But it seems to be this way with all pdf converter applications).

------------------------------------------------------------
I'm on day 1 of using this software.

Creating a PDF is working fine.

Converting an existing PDF to MS Word is working fine, so far.

Converting an existing PDF with a table inside it; into MS excel is working OK, so far.

Annoyances/problems:

1. After installing software onto my PC, an annoying ""activation"" NAG screen keeps popping up everytime/anytime I launch the program and/or toggle between CREATING a PDF vs CONVERTING a PDF.
Plus it decrements from 30 uses to none.

So off I went to ACTIVATE this whiner!

2. Activation:

a. I just went online, registered,  and then activated it, but apparently it requires further  MANUAL intervention by the enduser (lazy programmers at Nuance).
Because I am still getting the pop-up about not being activated.

b. License key & activation problems:
The setup/installation onto your PC works just fine with numbers and LOWER case letters . [For entering the alpha-numeric license code during installation of the software onto your PC].

But as soon as you get to Nuance's website and try to activate/register,
by using their ""Paste-serial-number-from-clipboard"" button, you get an error!
These boneheads keep kicking back your serial number as INCORRECT until you make it ONLY numbers and only ""UPPER case"" letters.
(why doesn't Nuance spend  a couple bucks on a 5 minute programming ""FIX""  and let the stinking webpage AUTO correct a small issue like these)

Next, trying to correct a serial number which was already ""pasted"" into the Nuance webform box [but contained lower-case letters]. Whenever I'd click my mouse next to a lower case letter and try to CHANGE it to an UPPERcase letter, a wretched pop-up window keeps WHINING about using ""The PASTE button function only"".
For every 1 lower-case letter you try to change to upper-case; you have to answer 2 pop-up windows and make them go away.
[Hey tightwads, fix your website's serial number entry form).
[Go to Elance and hire a programmer for (...) an hour and FIX the problem with ""YOUR"" [NUANCE's] website]

I tried to be  nice  and contact Nuisance (whoops, I mean Nuance) about their problem.
(Starting off an end-user experience like this is NOT going to endear me to rush out and buy any more NUANCE products; especially  if they can't make the registration & activation process easier, functional and more streamlined)

Here's a frustrating experience; Just try contacting these Tight-fisted pukes with a simple FYI, to tell them about a website issue of their's.

These pukes  expect you to shell out (...) per incident  just to contact them.
Sorry dudes, I'm not paying to fix YOUR website problems.

SUMMARY:

Pros - products looks/acts OK so far.
  - cheaper than Adobe

Cons - Just hope you NEVER need to contact NUANCE for ANYTHING.
Or I should say; PLAN to NEVER contact them.
[you can't even throw them a bone about how to improve their website without getting hit up for (...)]
 -poor activation web setup
 - Deceptive/hidden cost details about tech support :
  - no mention on software box
  - no mention inside box, nor in User manual

I bought this program for myself.
Once I test-drove it awhile, I was going to make recommendations to a large client about maybe switching to Nuance (from Adobe).
I really have my doubts now; especially regarding their ""nickel & dime-ing"" attitude toward their end-users.

09-24-2008 update:

I tried converting a bunch of pdf's to word, so i can work with the data within the pdf's.

The program goes fairly fast through the conversion process, until you reach 99%. Then it sits there for what seems like an eternity.

My core-2-duo is not pegged for CPU usage (only 25-50%), but the hard disk light is almost solid.

I found that this program really has a hard time with any text within a book's front cover. Mostly comes out as a mangled mess.
The text pages are decent in the translation.
But plan to run auto-format within Word, to get things cleaned up.",original

"Second year using TaxCut since I switched from TurboTax. The efile is $19.95 for a state return and was not available as a prepaid option this year. A big step back in the actual program was having to 'look' for an itemization. Right click in a cell, create an itemization. Go back to that field later and try to pull up the embedded itemization.... you are presented with a list of forms... WHAT! This is absurd, you have to hunt for the itemization. This is like going back to 1988. Since the interview doesn't list what form you are in at the time its difficult to find an itemization. That's why I started naming my itemizations. I can't remember TurboTax ever having this silliness.",original

"I had the following problems with TurboTax Premier 2012:
1) One inactive cell.  On one occasion, TubroTax had a prompt asking for a number to be entered in a highlighted cell, but the cell was inactive and would not accept any entry.  This single dead cell resulted in a return with an error, and TurboTax as a result would not file my returns despite lengthy efforts.
2) The step-by-step instructions on filing K-1 forms are muddled to the point of being impossible (for me) to use -- even after repeated attempts.  Twice TurboTax asked for information that went beyond that provided on my K-1 form itself, and which I had no idea how to answer.  One prompt suggested something like ""enter negative one in column A"".  I had no idea to what the prompt was referring.
3) TurboTax reported one discrepancy in values between those on my Federal and State returns although the values on my State return were loaded by TubroTax itself from my Federal return that TurboTax had just prepared.  Though unlikely, it seemed possible that the discrepancy was generated by TurboTax itself.
4) One error message (#3 above) offered no clear (to me) indication of where the error was occurring or how it might be fixed.
5) No useful help was available to trouble-shoot any of the difficulties above.",original
"I bought this for the reviews as I am turning 25 and facing adult acne.  I used it a couple times and it burned and gave these little flesh colored bumps on my forehead for a while.  After a couple at home peels and generic retinol cream, the bumps went away.  I figured my skin was too oily for it so I gave it to my mom who is 52 and has more dry skin.  The first night she used it, she broke out in little bumps under her chin.

So if you are looking for an astringent for acne, to not use this, it even says ""dry skin"" on the bottle.",original

"I purchased the 2013 Quicken before researching on Amazon - stupid error. First - I had the same trouble doing the transfer as other users - there was no warning that the password on my old file had to be removed before the upgrade was installed, so I could not open my data file.

So, three hours later, having finally deduced that there was no other option than to uninstall 2013 and reinstall 2010, then remove the password, reinstall 2013 (but this time in a separate directory)and transferred the file and decided against a password for now, tried entering a few transactions.

Rubbish! Total RUBBISH! Entering a price for a listed option took no time at all, but after each entry, the program ground away for up to 20 seconds before allowing entry of the next option price. (Quicken does not download option prices correctly, so they have to be manually entered) Everything is slowed down in the Budget area, making the feature valueless. Presentation is  changed for many reports, so you have to re-learn report building, etc. etc. etc.

After trying the system for several days, I uninstalled 2013, returned to 2010 Premier, and pray that Microsoft will see the errors of their ways and bring MSMoney back. Of course, when I took the software back to the retailer from whom it was purchased, demanding refund, the store refused - but one of the clerks told me that ""lots"" of people had returned theirs as well, and Intuit's response had been that the customers were just trying to cheat their way out of paying for ""a perfectly good product.""

A last point - Intuit gives you an on-line discount of 20% on their garbage product, some banks tout that they have negotiated the same 20% discount - Amazon makes it 30% - but I wouldn't buy it again with a 100% discount and an apology letter from the Chairman of the Board of Intuit after he fired the Intuit developers and their over-paid management for this software travesty.

 - - - - - subsequent update 1/1/2013

Glitches? You betcha !!! If you are working on a PC with a non-US keyboard and/or a non-US English compatible character set, you have to re-set your entire system to use the US English standard, which wreaks havoc with spreadsheets, correspondence and non-US proprietary software files. Reports are not easy to define when multiple currencies are involved, and currency conversion is confusing at best. Oh, yes - when you re-start your system after re-setting the character set, your internet connection parameters are lost, so figure on re-entering them from scratch - pay no attention to the error messages spat out by Quicken - they are wrong. Just re-set the connection, and re-start Quicken as soon as you calm down from your hissy fit about the absurdity of a badly-QC'd software from a $***&U*I outfit like Intuit.

BLACKMAIL !!! BLACKMAIL !!! BLACKMAIL !!! BLACKMAIL !!! I have used TurboTax from this same renegade outfit since before the Roman Empire was founded, and whilst having the occasional gripe, loved the tax preparation software. But if you purchase TurboTax 2012, IT WILL NOT TRANSFER YOUR DATA FROM THE 2010 QUICKEN SOFTWARE - YOU HAVE TO UPGRADE TO 2013 QUICKEN IN ORDER TO TRANSFER YOUR FINANCIAL DATA FROM 2012 !!!

This kind of entrapment of customers - deception if you are feeling charitable, highway robbery if you are being realistic  - is totally unacceptable, reprehensible and borderline theft. My license to use 2010 Quicken was valid throughout 2012, yet Intuit won't allow me to transfer my data to Turbotax because the license expires in 2013 ???

This kind of maltreatment of customers is why I curse the days of birth of the Intuit developers and their demonic management, and light candles to ask that their genes never be permitted to be passed on to another generation of thieves and scoundrels. I also pray that one day soon a team of honest developers (in a software company that doesn't have as its top priority the ravaging of the customer base in order to increase the value of stock options for the top managers) will write a solid tandem of software products that blows Intuit out of the water - and blasts those developers and managers back into the fires of Hades from whence they come.

Update 8 Jan 2013 - - - - -

If you have foreign accounts, beware! When transfers are made from Quicken 2013 (Q2013) of 2012 data entered in Q2010 and transferred into Q2013 because TurboTax 2012 (T2012) will not take data from Q2010 . . . Euros are not converted to Dollars when the transfer to Turbotax is made! My compensation is paid directly into an account in Europe denominated in Euros - but the transfer takes the total amount and calls it dollars. The interest on my bank account is kept as the same number, but shown as dollars, not Euros. Same for everything else I've checked so far. I don't think the IRS would be amused if I trusted Intuit's software. Neither should you.",original
"Sorry, but I don't like this one. I prefer Office 2010 much more. I'd like to really know why instead of making things more simple for the consumer, manufacturers make their products more difficult to use. This is another one of those products. This one has extra steps, extra doors to go through to do things normally done while on the main page. In this one you have to actually go into review step to spell check. Why the change? I've been using Word since Word 97 and loved it. I only bought this to replace 2010 and regret my decision. frankly, if I could return this product I would.
Fortunately, despite having a slow internet connection at 1 to 1.5GB, it downloaded without any problems, though it did take over an hour to do so. The Microsoft website does warn that depending on broadband speed, the download would take anywhere from 5 minutes to an hour and a half. I've been using it for the day since I purchased it yesterday without issues. On its own, it's a great product, but compared to its predecessors, it leaves much to be desired. And if anyone at Microsoft is listening and cares, why the changes? If something isn't broken, leave it alone. Isn't it bad enough that you didn't learn from Vista and then made Windows 8?",original
"I've been using Turbo Tax to file my federal and state income taxes for the past 5 years. It's definitely better than doing them by hand, but this year the program seemed a lot more cumbersome and lengthy than last year. And we had less things to deduct or pay this year.

Another thing it seemed to do was to print out duplicates and triplicates of not only the return but also bunches of worksheets that I'll probably never look at again or need. I had tons of paper when I finished. And I'm pretty sure that I didn't request all the extra copies.

Next year maybe I'll try Tax Cut or one of the other tax applications.",original

"I posted my review of Publisher 2000, when it existed, and basically feel the same way about 2002.  HOWEVER, I have a few more concerns.  I loaded it onto my computer to check it out.  I didn't like what I saw so I unloaded it.  Out of curiosity, I loaded it again.  It behaved as if I had never unloaded it the first time.  My alloted number of uses (before activation) decreased so something is still in there saying it was on there before (yes, yes, yes...in the registry).  Ok, Bill wants a new mansion so he is trying to prevent piracy.  I can understand that.  HOWEVER, my next concern is realllllyyy big.  In ME, you can set a restore point.  This restore point allows you to reconfigure your PC to a point from the past.  This is present just in case a new program you load has some problems, etc....  Now remember, ME is Mr. Gate's program just like Publisher.  I had to reformat my hard drive (thanks to Microsoft's Encarta Reference Library).  My system was fresh as a daisy.  I re-loaded Publisher out of curiosity to see what would happen.  I created a restore point PRIOR to loading it.  I didn't activate it because I didn't want it.  I unloaded it.  Just to test the system, I used my restore function.  If you are following me carefully, you can tell I have already made two changes since creating the restore point:  loading and unloading Publisher.  Guess What!?!  ME wouldn't allow the restoration because NOTHING HAD CHANGED ON MY PC!  HELLO???  I loaded and unloaded a program; I consider that a change.  Let's say Publisher had a problem and didn't work.  In order to get it off my PC, I would have to do ANOTHER format for my hard drive.  That, my friends, is scary.  And to add on to another person's review.  That person was incorrect when he/she said you could only have it on two PC's and would be out of luck if one crashed.  You can get it activated again and give some excuse as to why it needs to be reactivated (at least, that's what the support person told me).  But who wants to go through that every single time you want to load this program???  I know piracy exists but I don't see Microsoft in any financial distress.  I find it degrading that its customers have to do such a time-consuming procedure for a program which retails for $...  $..??  Maybe.  But $...??  That's pretty sad.  If you have it, stick with Publisher '98.  You can load it and not have to call Microsoft every time you need to install it.  I also challenge Microsoft to (A) Give me an upgrade worth $130 or (B) Give a better ""upgrade"" rebate ($...-Whooppeee!!).",original
"Not very pleased with this product, bought it to upgrade my older 2005 version & it is actually not as good as the old program. Push pins did not import properly & graphics are not a sharp as older version. Also errors in the new program are the same as in the old program.

For me it was a complete waste of money doing the upgrade. That said a newbie to the program might have a different feeling then I do and may like the program not knowing how the older version performed.

That is why I rated it as a 2 instead of a 1.",original

"This software has a nice interface and plenty of features for the home/consumer video enthusiast. There's also a great user support forum linked to the publisher's website.

Unfortunately, I found the program to be somewhat buggy and cannot recommend it. The most significant issue was that my PC's DVD drive wasn't recognized by the program when it was time to burn a disk. There were numerous, time consuming workarounds and fixes mentioned on the Video Studio forum. One user even solved his issue with the software by reinstalling his PC's operating system. But who wants to go through all that?

I downloaded the trial versions of Sony's Vegas Pro and DVD Architect Pro, as a previous reviewer suggested, and they worked just fine on the same PC. Those programs are definitely worth the extra money if you value your time.",original
"I ordered my first can of Toppick Hair Building Fibers based on the mostly good reviews by other users.  I agree that this is a good product.  It's not great, it doesn't make me suddenly look like I have lots of hair, but I must say that it is better than the hair I ""naturally"" have now.  Apparently due to aging, my once very thick hair has thinned drasically in the past ten years, and I have tried many, many products in an effort to either regrow hair, or to give the illusion of more hair.  Toppick is applied after shampooing, drying and styling, and on top of any other hair thickening products.  It is a fine powder that is manually shaken from the can. Toppick is sold in several different color shades and ""Light Brown"" is the first shade that I tried, as I have light brown hair with blond highlights, neither of which are my natural shade.  After the first few shakes, I discovered that there were more hair building fibers all over my shoulders, shirt and the bathroom than on my head.  I invested in the applicator made to fit over the top of the can and I urge anyone who is interested in trying Toppick, to do the same.  The nozzle-tip applicator makes it much easier and neater to apply this product.  The major plusses of Toppick are that it hides my shiny pink scalp and I find that the fibers do give the illusion of more hair.  The minuses include:  1.  I need to use a lot of Toppick to achieve the desired results, making this product more expensive than I thought it would be; 2.  I need to use a special ""spray"" to get the fibers to stick in place, adding another expense; 3.  Any time I comb or ""fix"" my hair during the day, the Toppick fibers come out, so I need to reapply which is not easily accomplished when not at home; and 4.  the powder texture dulls the look of my hair.
  Since the minuses are greater than the plusses, for me, I gave the Toppick Hair Building Fibers, Light Brown, only 3 stars.  Will I continue to use this product?  Absolutely - I haven't found anything else that hides my ""naked"" scalp and gives even a slight illusion of more hair as well as as the Toppick Fibers.  Will I continue to use Rogaine as well as other thickening and volume building products?  Absolutely - at least until a magic potion is developed to successfully regrow hair, or my vanity weakens.  If you are a mature woman and your crowning glory has been reduced to just a few strands, I would highly recommend that you give Toppick a try, just don't make your expecttions too high.",original

"I updated from 2011 to 2014 because they stated that they wouldn't provide downloading service after March 2014.  I went through all the steps required to update and everything seemed fine except when I went to Reconcile.  I had a charge account with very few entries.  I have done this proceedure for 15 plus years and always was able to Reconcile without problems.  I reconciled with 2014 and was off by -$30.67.  I triple checked my results and could find no error.  I contacted Quicken, which is a daunting task in itself, and told them of the problem.  They wanted me to manually check my results.  I told them this was a simple reconcile.  I asked for the next tier of service and they begrudingly sent me a link.  The next Customer Rep I sent Windows Screen Shots of all my work and then they paid attention.  They had me check all sorts of menus and could find nothing.  The only thing they said was to sign up and do an electronic download of the account.  I don't like to do this because I don't want Quicken to know my acccounts or anyone to hack Quicken accounts and get my records.  In the end I made an adjustment to my accounts to bring the balance to the correct amount.  I will see what happens next month.  In the mean time I reconciled another of my accounts and I ended up on +$60 this time.

"I tried the downloaded version first - it would not run on an infected computer. Since most people buy an anti-virus program after the fact, this is kind of important.  Norton's alternative: Install the software on a non-infected compyter with the sam OS (I had Windows 98 - everyone I know has ME, XP, etc.) - not a good option.  I purchased the CD.  Then the real install nightmares started.  The interface is all HTML based - there's a TON of scripting problems - their support site has many, many, MANY pages of help for these.  My two questions to tech support (using their on-line system, 24 hour guaranteed answer time) took over two weeks to have answered - and the answer did not even apply to my question.
So the support rating is a big, fat, zero.  After I finally got it to install (in safe mode - it crashed any other way), it would not configure correctly - more script errors.  Had to download almost a dozen files from Norton and Microsoft to take care of these problems.
Now it runs fine, squashes bugs flat, etc. But it's still crashes whenever I try and configure it - unless I reboot in safe mode. A real pain.
As far as virus killing, it's great. I had a friend install hers on an XP system - worked and installed perfectly.  ME and 98 are not so lucky. 95 - forget it - it automatically installs an older version.",original
"I have installed the Win Cleaner program on both XP and Vista.  When I tried to update them I was informed that I had used up my updates and that I should purchase another update.  Also, I was advised that if this was not actually true I could file for a ""ticket"" to fix the problem.  I went to the ""WinCleaner"" website, left a message, and wrote down the Ticket Number they assigned.

Then I did the One Click thing on the original program. It did improve the boot time.  So, without the update, I reduced boot time from five minutes to four minutes.  This is some improvement. Wow, 20% faster boot  time.  But it still would not update.  I used email aqain to voice my complaint.

The next day I received an email from ""WinCleaner"" with a hyperlink to download a new program.  I did this and rebooted my machine.  Then I ran the One Click program again.  Then, after installing the download on my three computers, it seemed to run as advertised.

###-UPDATE-###

10/22/10

Okay, so I finally got the kinks worked out in July of 2009. But I was not quite satisfied.  I decided to install ""DriveScrubber 3.""  It removed much more  after running ""WinCleaner.""  Using the two programs together I felt reasonably well covered.

Then I made the mistake of running the program past the expiration date.  Rather than simply being cut off from further use until I renewed, it failed to notify me and instead destroyed my Registry.  Of course, ""WinCleaner"" no longer runs properly.  Now, each time I boot up my computer, I have to stop several programs that are all trying to run at the same time.  Of course, I could maybe fix this problem by simply buying another year of ""WinClearner"" use.  But I think I'll download that free program ""Windows Registry Repair"" before I decide.  With ""DriveScrubber 3"" and the free ""Windows Registry Repair,"" I should be well enough covered.  Maybe I can get off this treadmill.  All this is sure a lot of time consuming trouble!",original

The main page is useless and you now have to open multiple windows to get the information you need, then you have to close all the windows you opened to get to the next account.  When looking at a performance page of your investment accounts you get a pie chart instead of a bar graph.  What good is a pie chart when you are looking at performance data over a specific time range.  I thought the purpose of newer versions was to improve the existing version and not regress.  If Microsoft still had a financial program I would be forced to migrate to another program.  Intuit needs to change it's company name because this program is not intuitive.  It is ill conceived and makes for a frustrating experience.",original

"I bought this to use with Xfer-ing my old VHS ""How to"" videos to DVD.

1st problem was that the 2nd, bonus CD's serial number was coming up as invalid.

2nd problem: Unable to capture any video.

I have 4 different video capture devices:
1. pinnacle (bought in 2008)
2. Dazzle 100 series (bought in 2008)
3. Dazzle 150b
4. ADS tech X2 (bought in 2007)

Despite trying with all 4 devices, I keep getting the error,""Cannot start Capture graph"".

Amazingly the corel website does NOT even list this error in the search results!?
Yet when googling for it, you'll find this user problem on probably a 100 + webpages.

(I guess if corel denies the problem exists, then they don't have to address/fix it)

This is the first FULL video editor package I have bought in years.
Each of the 4 RCA to USB video capture devices came with either an
SE ""special edition"" or LE ""Light edition"" of either pinnacle studio or Ulead videostudio.
All the stripped down programs actually WORK.
The full version of Videostudio 11.5 does NOT!!!

After numerous update attempts, repair attempts, remove & re-install attempts, I gave up.
I never had a ulead[corel] program be so messed up.

I had a copy of videostudio plus X2 on order (it came up on amazon on sale for $39.99 last weekend).
Today I saw that it had not be shipped, so I cancelled the X2 version.

The lack of knowledge base support for an application with serious issues, is criminal.  For crying out loud, just fix it with a patch and list the fix in the corel knowledgebase.
To omit it from the corel website is the sign of a real craptastic company.
I always liked ulead products until this one.

A huge disappointment.",original
"Update Jan 4, 2012. I wrote a glowing report for this Kaspersky Internet Security 2012. Unfortunately, I started having a problem with my desktop computer locking up for ten minutes. The hard drives worked like crazy but I had no control over the computer and no way to find out what was causing the problem. Then it would go back to ""normal."" This hadn't happened before I got this software.

I started working on the various programs, eliminating, re-loading, etc. When I got to Kaspersky, it wouldn't uninstall. I had to use another program to uninstall it and clean up the junk it left. Then I tried to re-install it. It refused to install, since there was some bit of a program missing. However, since it didn't tell me what was missing, I couldn't fix it. In addition, it had evidently changed some of my settings, so even with administrator permission, I could not get into some folders without ""administrator approval."" It also changed my screen so that my gadgets didn't show up!

A decent program will uninstall and re-install easily and without leaving a lot of junk. And when it uninstalls itself, it returns the settings to the way they were when it arrived. I know this is possible since I have a lot of programs that do it easily. Kasp is too much like the viruses that I am trying to avoid.

I use this on two other computers (notebooks) and it works fine. However, it is finally off of my desktop and has been replaced.",original

"I have been using either Norton or McAfee for several years and have had various degrees of success with each.  I was always irritated that I had to buy so many copies just because I have multiple computers in the house.  This set sort of solved that in that it would protect 3 PCs, but technically, only one person could ever use any of the computers.  If you have a family, you know that is not how life is.

I finally got fed up with this version after having issues with their support to be able to reload the software again on a computer that I updated software on.  For some reason, the update caused an issue and I had to remove the software.  When I went to load it back on, I was told I had already used my three installs.

After a bit of frustration, I installed Microsoft Defender (free) and have not looked back since.  I now have all of my computers legally covered for anyone in the house using them and I do not have to pay a yearly fee for it.

Because of the above (not legally being able to have more than one person use the computer and problems being able to do a reload), I find that I cannot recommend this software.",original

"I'll start by saying that I really like Pca products but this is definitely not one of them. I didn't care much for this toner theres not much I can say except that I prefer the pca nutrient toner it is smaller and a bit pricier but it leaves my face better plus it smells great.

UPDATE I am a big fan of PCA skin products and I had to update this review because I really believe I was sold an expired toner and other PCA products. I stopped buying PCA products on amazon after comparing them to the ones I bought with my dermatologist or @skinstore.com. I noticed that while everything was the same the expiration dates on the products I bought on amazon where different and where able to come off. Sadly I can't remember the vendor but there must be a reason why they are cheaper here when other sites like dermstore.com or skinstore.com will not even give a small discount on PCA products (PCA products are always excluded from promotions).
The A&C serum I bought came in the old container that had a defective pump if you buy this serum on other skin care sites they have  the newer (better quality) container which is a bit taller and has a better pump.
With that said choose the vendor carefully.",original

"If you have ilife 06 then you may want to read a more in depth review then I can offer. If you have ilife 08 or none then this might be a good purchase.

I generally only use iPhoto, iMovie and iDvd. iPhoto has gotten a bit more annoying with features that I would never use. So your mileage will vary. iDvd did not have any remarkable changes so I won't remark on them. iMovie has a dramatically different user interface and does add a lot of features but also made the simple into more of a difficulty. I am on the fence as to if the added editing features are worth the additional time it takes to edit a movie.

"I have mixed feelings about this product.  It has bailed me out from a C: disk crash.  However, I had many issues with the software (I will give examples below), support for problems is practically non existent (help only from the forums where other people are having the same issues)  and when the crash happened I had very little hope that it would work. But it did.  I now switched to a different back up method.

When I bought this software, I wanted to have a backup history of about a month so I can go back to the old files if I made some sort of mistake.  My hope was to run a full back up once a week, and then have differential backs 6 times a week, this way I could fit 7 different backups on a large disk designated for backups.  The software claims to have a function that allows it to delete old backups based on a condition (% of disk full for example).  But that never worked. Many other people complained about the same problem.  When the disk became full, it simply stopped backing up.  I had to remember to manually free up disk.

Then I upgraded to a next version of the software which was supposed to have these problems fixed.  However, the fix was to remove the functionality and what I wanted to do was not possible.  The new version still had problems with incremental backups at disk full situation.  In fact I left it double the amount of space necessary for one backup (as the forums indicated it needs temporary space while the backup is working).  Finally, the only solution that worked was to have a full back up every day, with a rule that the previous copy had to be deleted before the new backup was created.  Occasionally, it would still fail with messages that made no sense at all.  I could get it to work again sometimes, if I deleted several backups and ran disk defragmenter. But this did not always help.  And then in a few days it would begin working again.  So it felt fragile and unreliable.

As I was having various issues I contacted support several times (support is via email), they would get back to me in 2-3 weeks requesting some additional log file, to which they would respond maybe in another 2-3 weeks.  By then whatever they said was not relevant, because I could not just wait for 4-6 weeks for a possibly helpful response. I would just wipe out the backups and start all over.

Because the regular backups felt flakey, I also created ""secure zone"" back up, which is an option to have a backup on a separate partion.  When the disk crashed, restore from secure zone did not work.

So overall, using it was a very frustrating experience which was shared by a large number of other users based on the forum postings.  The forum was the only place where I could get ideas of for possible solutions, and validation that the problems I was having were not unique to me.

However there are some positive things about the product
1.  The feature that allows you to mount a back up and easily retrieve an old file as if it was just another volume is very nice
2.  The backups are fairly quick. I tried using Windows native back up and on my disks it did not even completed in 24 hours.  Acronis backup for all my disk completed overnight (when it worked), when it did not it would sit at the prompt complaining about something with inscrutable message.
3.  Finally, when the disaster struck and my c: drive crashed, I was able to do a restore my C: drive from the backup to a brand new drive and it worked.  I did not have to reinstall windows, all my settings and customization were preserved.

Bottom line, this is only for those who have no other options.  It requires constant baby-sitting.  You need to manually check if it worked on daily basis, delete files, and  just pay constant attention to it.  But what you want from a backup is to enable it and forget it until you need it.",original

"When Amazon came out with downloading music 8 years ago, they had honestly made the leap forward into brining the forefront of entertainment to the internet, but it all has came down to the need of having music available to meet the demands of services like Rhapsody, Napster, and ITunes. But what Amazon had done has been both rewarding, and well worth the money. Amazon's Music Streamer does work nicely, where you can download great music to your laptop, stored through their cloud, or play music you already have on your laptop. My one gripe about the services, is that it lags the volume quality other music servers have like Apple's ITunes and Windows Media Player. Still, it honestly is worth its value. I honestly though is that you could have better services, so you could shop through their MP3 Store, without a lot of hassle. But mostly, you do get what you pay for in the full equalizer.

"I have printshop 20.  It spoiled me.  It had no bugs that I ever found.  Printshop 3.0 on the hand has more bugs than I can count.  It seems that they cut a lot of corners in testing this software.  When typing, the marker where you are, it disapears. I am thinking of going back to 20.

Since I 1st wrote this review I have been trying to print envelopes.  I have never had more problems. The print instructions call out landscape mode but the program prints in partially in the potrait mode and most of it not at alll. When trying to contact Broderbund I go in circles.  They won't answer their phone.  They support center says I can send an email, but that part does not work.  One star rating is too much.
Continued efforts have gotten answers.  But not to my questions.  They answer the question, but not to the question I asked.  I have upgraded to 3.0.5 and still no solutions to the problems.  I think they are having great financial problems

How would you like to make a card with lots of stuff and it won't let you print.  Instead it crashes and you lose everything.  I keep looking for and update that makes it more useable but so far no luck.",original

XP Home SP3 installed. I purchased to clone a 640G SATA from an 80G PATA. Install and update ok. 64 character serial code a bit much but done. Clone instructions are straight forward. The software failed the Automatic clone and also Manual clone attempts in Windows. Acronis promptly responded with a current version image of the program. Downloaded and installed on a CD with Easy CD Creator.  Tap F8 on boot and directed to the CD. Image Home opened and I elected Manual option for partition and within 10 minutes had a new bootable HDD. I tried Acronis in Windows to Wipe the old disk and it failed. Also failed Safe mode.  Used the provided bootable image to erase the HDD. Slick software and saved several hours of tedium  installing OS and Programs.,original

"If I think this product is worth less than 1 star, why did I buy it?  Because I had the 2007 version and it worked ok, although weak on spyware detection. I had a 2 year license and would have been happy to simply extend it for a reasonable fee.  Unfortunately Kaspersky is greedy beyond belief and wanted more for a simple license renewal than I could buy a whole new boxed version at a local brick and mortar store.

I checked Amazon and they had AV 2009 for under twelve bucks (unexplicably today they are selling the same ""old version"" for sixty bucks. What is up with that?).  So it was an easy decision to pay the twelve rather than the outrageous renewal fee.  MISTAKE!

As others have pointed out my computer immediately slowed down to the speed of something from 1963.  Okay, I know didn't have computers in 1963 but you get my point.  This version doesn't do anything different, why is it such a resource hog?

As others have pointed out, KAV2009 does NOT play well with Microsoft Office.  I immediately began having problems saving files because the AV software was trying to protect the file.  How can anyone work with MS Office if they can't save files?  If I turn KAV2009 off, Office works perfectly, turn it back on and the problem happens again. There is no doubt that the AV software is at fault.  How can any software manufacturer try to sell a product that doesn't work with MS Office?

I've had it for about a week and simply can't live with the turtle-slow performance so even though I have almost a full year to go I have ordered another brand to replace it.  I have nothing good to say about KAV2009.",original

"I just bought this from Amazon and, sadly, I think I'll have to return it on compatibility grounds.

So far, I've only tried Quattro Pro.

Excel Macros don't work.

I still haven't figured how to get into Basic - that menu item is shaded and doesn't seem to work.

Standard spreadsheet functions like @OFFSET do not appear to work - I checked HELP and the syntax seems to be the same as for Excel but I gave up trying to figure out how to get my working Excel sheet to return any kind of VALUE (you can do that in Excel) - what I got instead was some weird string that looks like a REFERENCE.  I did figure out how to rewrite my @OFFSET calls to @INPUT calls - took a while.  This brings back memories of the Borland days of Quattro Pro - back then the spreadsheet would freeze sometimes when moving columns around.

You can tell from this that I care a lot about the compatibility of QP with Excel (I have to care).  Now if you don't care about compatibility then this is not an issue.

On the WordPerfect side - a long, long time ago I got my whole company (1,000 employees) to switch from DOS Wordstar to DOS WordPerfect.  I'm sure I'd like this version of WP - but importing equations is important to me and, sadly, according to one of the reviews here, that doesn't work either.",original

"The ""Acronis Extended Capacity Manager"" which ""allows your operating system [sic] support large capacity disks with the MBR partition style"" (quoting from paragraph 8.8 of the User's Guide, poor grammar and all) has the ""unadvertised feature"" of disabling the RAID configuration of a computer.  My Intel motherboard (Model DH67BL) with a Windows 7 64 bit operating system running ""Intel Rapid Storage Technology"" software allowed me to add or remove backup storage drives (both MBR and GPT configurations) without affecting system operation.  But after adding ""Acronis True Image 2014"" this feature ceased to work - I had to shut down the computer to disconnect an eSATA hard drive.  I removed the ""Acronis True Image 2014"" software, was warned in the process that I would loose the ""benefits"" of ""Extended Capacity Manager"", rebooted, and then RAID worked as before.  Therefore ""Extended Capacity Manager"" appears to ""manage"" hard drives you didn't ask or want it to.

The other big issue - backup filenames - was already cited by previous reviewers.  But, silly me, I thought Acronis may have been prompted by such negative feedback to fix that issue by the time I tried their software.  Not so.  When I did an initial full ""File backup"", it ignored the backup name I had specified and chose its own.  This can get very confusing when you back up more than one computer and you are not allowed to use your own file naming convention to keep the backups differentiated from each other.  That was bad enough.  But then when I did an incremental ""File backup"", the Acronis software suddenly decided to use the name I had asked it to use in the first place.  The consequence was another FULL file backup using the specified name.  So, thus far, two full backups and no incremental backups.  I didn't try a third time to see what it would do.  This ""unadvertised feature"" reminded me of a ""one-armed bandit"" gambling machine.

When I did a ""Disk and Partition"" backup the Acronis software also ignored the backup name I had specified.  I didn't try an incremental backup for this; I already had the two foregoing reasons to remove the software.

If anyone wants a recommendation for viable backup software, I have two.  For disk image backups, StorageCraft's ShadowProtect software works very well.  This is sold by the Manufacturer only.  For file backups, Genie-Soft's Backup Manager Professional works very well.  Amazon.com used to carry it and I have a positive review posted for it.  It can still be purchased from the Manufacturer.  Norton/Symantec has lost the edge they used to have in this market since their Ghost 14.0 product.  And Acronis . . . well, who would have thought to invent backup software that tries to reconfigure your computer's previously-working hard drive operation and features a random backup filename generator that actuates when you try an incremental backup?",original

"I just finished my federal/state return on TurboTax and the experience motivates me to seek an alternate supplier for my next year's filing.

To my surprise, this year's edition of TurboTax appears to be harder to use, more cumbersome, less trustworthy than the previous year's.

- Entries that I had little difficulty filing last year - local income tax (yes, we have that) paid to the local tax collector but not recorded on the W2 - were buried in a maze of difficult to comprehend options hiding behind the cheerful, 'easy to use' interface.
- Information, once entered, is sometimes hard to retrieve or readjust. The program creates dozens of worksheets and forms, most of them useless or unneeded and it's not easy to get to the source entry for some specific item of information. It's all in there, mind you, but so is the needle hiding in that proverbial haystack.
- Attempts to revise or check information force a choice between plunging into the 'user-friendly' and largely redundant branch or the confusing maze of inter-connected forms, schedules and worksheets where it's difficult to impossible to anticipate the consequences of adjusting some specific figure to the return overall.
- The program seems to be generating its own errors by creating worksheets on its own and then, when error-checking is run, finding that it doesn't have sufficient information to back... nothing. For example, it didn't know how much income did I generate by using my house as a home office, even though I never even HINTED that I did that.
- The HELP engine that comes with the program is almost completely useless and its online branches are from 'inconsistent' to 'frustrating' to 'maddening'. For example. I was able to find some online discussions on how to enter my local income tax amount but I had to spend some precious time navigating through the HELP maze. In may case, I found another customer's advice but, it turns out, in most cases, you must first crate a UserID on the 'LiveCommunity'. And, of course, for ONLY $29.95 some 'live' adviser would be happily and cheerfully answer any basic question that you may have that the HELP facility should have included to begin with.

I am lucky because my tax return is relatively simple but I can see how much more frustrating the experience could be for those whose tax return needs are more sophisticated than mine.

Do not let it ""repair"" your system automatically.  My computer still crashes, freezes and takes a long time to boot, although it seems to operate a little faster between crashes.  I will be making some more changes recommended by the program but very selectively.  As somebody else noted, they want $30 every year I don't know if the program stops working after a year or it it just stops updating.",original

Upgraded from Quicken 9 to Quicken 11. Been a very happy Quicken user for many years.
Quicken 11 is missing the cash flow tab/function (in/out/whats left).

Beware of this upgrade if you want this function. Its gone!!
Shame on Intuit.

Update 12/4/10 to this review:
Quicken has updated the program with update R4 which brings back the cash flow tab.
It is now beter than ever. It has to be customized to a tab function. This tab can now be customized

"If you have ilife 06 then you may want to read a more in depth review then I can offer. If you have ilife 08 or none then this might be a good purchase. Having gone from ilife 06 to ilife 09, the differences were more then just an annoyance in any learning curve. I generally only use iPhoto, iMovie and iDvd. iPhoto has gotten a bit more annoying with features that I would never use. So your mileage will vary. iDvd did not have any remarkable changes so I won't remark on them. iMovie has a dramatically different user interface and does add a lot of features but also made the simple into more of a difficulty.

"Quicken marketing is promoting ""new larger font option"" as one of the primary new and improved features along with better budgeting and redesigned debt cutting tools.  These new features are fitting for the current economy and will appeal to buyers to view their shrinking net worths and help them get out of debt.  Genius marketing and product enhancement! ;-)

This review is for upgrading from Quicken 2011 to 2012.  In summary don't expect a lot of feature enhancement, and 2012 appears to be a (mostly) stable release.  I'm a long time Quicken user who upgrades annually.  I use Quicken extensively and my data file is 125Mb with accounts which have thousands of transactions, some dating back to 1993.  The upgrade and conversion from Quicken 2011 to 2012 was seamless.  All of my connections (mostly Direct Connect) to financial institutions worked as they did before.  There are some cosmetic enhancements to the user interface.  I noticed some but not significant performance improvements (I use Quicken on Windows 7 32-bit running on a mid-performance dual core laptop with 4GB of RAM).  Interfacing to financial institutions and downloading transactions appears to have some stability improvement.  There are still some bugs from prior versions which I have learned to work around.  Occasionally Quicken crashes or hangs-up; however, I have never lost transaction data in this version or prior versions.  I can't comment on the enhancements to budgeting and debt cutting tools as I don't use them.

The software is probably getting long in the tooth and requires significant changes to its core architecture.  Quicken was originally designed as a replacement for the checkbook and not managing thousands of investment transactions.  For instance a 401(k) account with an asset allocation among several funds and an employer match which makes purchases each pay period results in thousands of downloaded transactions over a few years.  In the portfolio view, Quicken is painfully slow when displaying an account with many transactions.

With a shift towards cloud computing and use of tablets/mobile devices (and Intuit's acquisition of mint.com), Intuit is unable to significantly invest in the architectural changes required for the existing desktop version of Quicken.  I don't envision significant changes in the future to the desktop version but bug fixes and minor enhancements.",original

"I recently upgraded to Kaspersky 2011 on all six of my Windows computers.  Five are running XP and one is Windows 7.  All of them stopped running I until I finally gave up and uninstalled Kaspersky 2011.  ""Kaspersky support"" is an oxymoron.  There is NONE!  When you try to find Help they take you to a web page that encourages you to upgrade to 2012 (free).  I tried it but it produced the same problem.  The culprit is a program called AVP.EXE.  It takes over 99% of the processor cycles and more than 400 MB of memory (RAM).  That sure keeps the viruses away!?  Nothing else can run in that environment:  no virus and no program either.  The computer becomes worse than useless.  Kaspersky 2011 and 2012 have wasted three days of my valuable time while I diagnosed, tried to repair and finally had to uninstall.  Even the uninstaller had trouble getting enough cycles to complete.

The good news is that there is a happy ending.  I have uninstalled Kaspersky and my computer is working fine again.  Now I will have to waste the rest of the day fixing the other five computers.",original

"The whole package of the Amazon Cloud, your digital library, and this player are all woven together, but the product isn't complete, and as a result there are some problems that--when Amazon addresses them--will make this product an excellent option for your music collection.  Until then, these are what I would consider to be show-stopping issues, and you should probably be aware of them up front.

First, whenever you purchase music from Amazon, a digital copy is already automatically stored in your library for you.  You are given a limited amount of storage that you can use to upload MP3s of your own, and Amazon will put them into your library.  For a small fee, you can increase the amount of storage to a whopping 250,000 songs.  So far, that means my entire massive CD collection, which I recently re-ripped A to Z, would fit perfectly online.  All well and good.

But then we get to that task of adding music.  The Cloud Player has an option in the menu to add music, but it launches a browser page where you have to manually manage the upload process.  Not a huge inconvenience, but a bit awkward, as it also requires the installation of the Amazon Music Importer, a separate application that really just acts as a go-between, from the browser to your computer, solely for the upload process.

The act of uploading appears to be a two-step process:
- if Amazon already has that album/song in its Cloud, then you get it added without having to manually push your copy from your computer up into your library.  It's like Amazon makes a note that this belongs to you and lets you have access to their copy of it.
- if Amazon 'can't match' the file, it simply won't upload it.  The criteria for 'can't match' are pretty hazy.  On the one hand, I see in the instructions that your MP3s need to be a certain range of quality:  not too high or too low of a bitrate when you ripped them.  I haven't had anything rejected for this reason though because my music is a Continuous Bit Rate 256Kbps.  But on the other hand, I get a response from the uploader that a song was rejected because it 'couldn't be matched'...and it doesn't seem like it should be.  For example, I have a clean rip of an album, but tracks 3, 8, and 12 couldn't be matched, so just a portion of the album was uploaded.  Confusing.

Using the player has been a great experience:  it's not hard to drill down, I get the (weird-looking) idea that searches blur the entire app screen while I'm typing, then bring me back to the results.  I can easily figure out how to make playlists, drag things back and forth, sort and filter by artist, album, etc., and getting the player going is a no-brainer to anyone who's used a media player of any kind.

But then I've gotten tripped up by DRM (and believe me, I've discussed this with Amazon).  The Amazon Cloud Player allows you to 'register' up to 10 devices to be able to use the service.  That's a pretty fair number, and despite how many phones, tablets, consoles, and computers we have around the house, even if for some reason I went nuts and tried to make everything run the Cloud Player, I'd still come in just shy of 10 devices.  If 'register' were really a device-specific operation.  Unfortunately, there are two huge problems with managing your devices:

1) ""Registering"" can happen at any time, more than once, and the player treats a re-occurrence as a new device.  I installed this on my laptop and it Registered:  so my device count went up by one.  At some point later in the day, it Registered itself again, and now the laptop counted as two.  The next morning, I turned on the laptop and it said I had exceeded the limit, because it tried to Register yet again, and now my laptop counted as three...and I was over 10.  I thought that was weird, so I logged into my account and discovered that related Amazon-items, like my phone and my daughter's phone, were not only registered as potential users of the Cloud Player (because they use the Amazon App Store), but that all my devices had gobbled up the number of Registrations by being on the list more than once.

2) ""Deregistering"" imposes a 30-day penalty:  if you need a new slot, you need to deregister a device, wait 30 days, and on day 31 you can now add another.  But at some point you can expect that device to have to re-register itself and take up another slot in the 10-device list.

I've had to communicate with Amazon on this situation a couple of times, mostly because even when I name a device, if it re-registers itself without telling me, Amazon makes up a name and it's hard for me to tell which device 'forgot' who it was and re-added itself.  The solution they suggest to me is to Deregister everything and start again.  You can click a ""Deregister All"" button, but if you do, you need to read the fine print:  at the bottom of the page it tells you that you can only do a ""Deregister all"" once per year.

Why?

I've yet to understand why any of this works the way it does.  But at the end of the day, I've paid Amazon money for a year of storage, reached a certain point in uploading my library, and had all my slots arbitrarily used up.  The support answer was to remove everything, and now I'm waiting a month to use the service I've paid for, knowing that unless Amazon fixes this weirdness, it'll break again and something will have to go without for a month while I wait for permission to return to the cloud.

The Amazon Cloud Player has the potential to be great.  In the meantime, expect some awkward problems.",original

"Webroot reminds me of AVG, but is a bit more streamlined. It does it's work in the background, and seems to do it
very well. I have been a life long Norton user ever since I learned PC-Dos (not ms-dos) from Peter Nortons book (I still have it).
Over the past few years I have been getting more and more frustrated with Norton, and did not totally trust AVG, as it was a bit twitchy.
So far I am pleased with Webroot after dumping Norton antivirus which was becoming too much work.  Windows platforms are hard enough
to maintain without having to deal with antivirus software that you constantly have to update and scan, and comes in to load the latest version, that then asks you to send money when your existing version still has over 300 days to go.
When doing web searches, Webroot will mark each with trusted, questionable, or no markings to let you know whether or not to go there.
Webroot works in the background, and will always come up when you first start your computer to let you know it is working.
After many tries to get an answer from webroot, the people on Amazon finally came up with what I asked: YOU CAN USE ANY UN-USED CD IN ANY YEAR which is much like Norton.
At under $20.00 for 3 PC's, I really can't find a better deal/software, and at this price, what is stopping you from giving it a try.

"Because of nerve damage I have a difficult time typing and thought that this software would be useful.  I purchased a good digital microphone and installed the software.  Setup seemed easy enough and the learning software was reasonable.  I didn't use it much because it seemed to have problems with Microsoft products (though I could buy an upgrade that - in theory - worked better).  A couple weeks later I purchased another piece of software for learning a foreign language and soon neither worked.  I uninstalled the language software and reinstalled the Dragon software and was plagued by a window that was always trying to re initiate the program (never successfully).  Not an uncommon problems I researched it!  If I completely wiped out the program (including deleting the sub-directory and clearing out the registry) the program would work once.  I have Windows 7 64bit, 12 gigs of ram, an i7 chip and 2 terabytes of HD space so hardware should not be a problem.  I gave up on Nuance.

Then the cards and email came from Nuance to buy version 11.  They were worse than the most persistent telemarketer.  I ignored all the cards and mail and then the phone calls came.  Even after I listened to one sales person's entire pitch and told them no repeatedly they STILL called and emails every day.  I rue the day i gave them a valid phone number, email address and home address.  If you do buy this software give them a PO box and not your real phone number!!

How well does the software work?  Not great, but acceptable for someone who has the time and patience to go back over and correct 30%.

The new software claims a MUCH better rate of recognition.  Instead of giving purchasers an update, they chose to soak people by getting them to buy a new package.

In 2011, thankfully that bug is gone, but now I have discovered a bug when accepting downloaded transactions in investment accounts. When you accept one transaction and it moves to the next, the accept button no longer functions unless you click on another transaction and back to the one you want to accept.

Then, of course, when you go back and try again, your data is often correct--after all you just entered a four digit number! Why would that break a system?

So, yes, believe the reviews. I haven't even started the individual tax return and I am worried. I might be buying TaxAct or whatever I can find before this tax season is over because my trust level is kaput. I could do 1099s online at the IRS site or handwrite them, they are the easiest, simplest form I will deal with over the next few months. But I bought TurboTax to make it even easier. And if it can't handle these, well, I shudder and I worry.

And if you are in the same boat as me and bought early before the reviews and WANT to try this anyway, well, the functionality is slightly better in Google Chrome over IE 8. Not much but at least I got a file to transfer on my sixth attempt on Chrome. So my names were imported from last year's file. Never mind that it said it didn't and then it transferred the file twice and now won't let me delete the duplicates without that lovely Houston message I shared above. I finally got one to delete after 8 attempts. I may not be so lucky with the rest of them.

So yes. Crap. Utter, useless crap. I want a refund but it is software so that's not possible since I've ripped open the box and loaded this simulation of a tax preparer.

This is my 9th year using TurboTax and by far the worst experience I have ever had with it. Phooey on Intuit.

UPDATE on 1/31/12:

After countless attempts at data entry in the online 1099/W2 Reporter system, I finally got my 8 1099s completed. It took me 6 hours of repeated attempts to get the data entered. Yes, I was foolish. I could have done it somewhere else in less than an hour. Then I read in another review here that there is a backend way to do the reports through the software.

Click FILE in the upper left hand corner menu and select NEW TAX RETURN and the selection like previous years. For kicks and giggles I decided to do that after finally printing up and mailing the 1099s today, a few days past when I intended. The whole process took me 15 minutes, what it has done in previous years. Why did Turbo Tax not give us the outright option? Why did they release extremely flawed online software? (Even selecting a state doesn't work in the drop down boxes unless you hit a hard enter after selecting, otherwise it clears out the field when you move to the next one. Nevermind the inability to process submitted info, the forms can't even handle data entry such as 5 digit only zip codes, etc.)

So this is too little too late for me and for you, but perhaps someone will be saved the headache.

And do save that return for the 1099/W2s in the software (the work around) because even though you save it, it doesn't not come up as an option for your ongoing working returns in the open file page. You have to browse for it on your computer--know where you saved it!--if you need to access it again.

Pure idiocy...",original
"I have had a couple of different versions of Quicken over my life. My last was version 2012 and I hated it. Every time I would sync my checking account, I had to reconcile since it typically missed pulling in things. When it missed a few, it became cumbersome to even want to use it, so I uninstalled.

Now version 2013.  I was happy that setting up accounts was even easier with this version. I got everything synced and thought it looked good. I synced again after a few days and wouldn't you know it, my checking account (different bank this time) was wrong. It was missing entries. I deleted, set it up again, which does take a while  assigning categories. I did a sync a few days later and this time it was fine.  Great I thought.  I just synced again today and sure enough, it is missing several entries.  One from over a week ago.  If I delete the account and set it up again, those same entries do come over, so it is not like it is a pending transaction.

So, I hate this software. Two different versions, different banks, and it still skips downloading entries.  What good is financial software if it does this?  I want to use it for its most basic functionality and that fails for me miserably.

If Quicken support comments, yes, I have the latest updates. i also had them with 2012 and it did not matter then either.",original

"We've been running Trend Micro for the last 10+ years, and thought it was pretty good. Then we started having serious problems with our computers, specifically slowing down, failing to recognize hyperlinks, failing to transmit passwords properly (e.g., the New York Times), interference with websites (e.g., amazon failing to operate properly) and the security software itself turning off spontaneously. Yet this software failed to recognize the problem.

So, I loaded the free security software that comes with Windows 7 (Microsoft Security Essentials), and in short order it identified two notorious pieces of malware (VCQ.exe and DropInSavings) plus seven lesser ones. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to reach the conclusion to replace Trend Micro with Microsoft Security Essentials or some other security software that actually works.",original

"Norton Internet Security 2007 has to be one of the worst products that I have ever purchased.  It slowed my PC to an unacceptable level.  When I disabled some of its unnecessary functions, it continued to slow my PC and gave me the bonus of irritating & uneccesary notifications/ warnings.  I was a longtime, dedicated user of Norton, but that has changed.  Try something else and avoid reduction of speed, adding an addtional bar to screen your screen, additional clutter and other deficiencies. If Amazon had a rating for less than one star, I would have given one of those negative ratings.

"I bought TaxCut because at the time TurboTax had a stupid policy of charging an extra $10 for each printed tax return.  They later reversed this, but I had already started preparing a year-end planning pro forma return using TaxCut.  Now that I've used the product, it would have been better to stick with TurboTax even if I had to pay extra to print a planning return.  (And of course, now TurboTax has dropped that stupid charge, so it's no longer a problem.)

TaxCut advantages:  (1) it's a little cheaper, and (2) it has some limited audit protection service built in.  While I don't think it's as good as the extra-cost ($35) audit offering available for TurboTax, but for a relatively simple return it may save you from buying that kind of insurance.  That's it.  In every other way TurboTax is better.

Here are just some of the TaxCut deficiencies:  (1) Interview is MUCH less thorough.  I found numerous areas where TurboTax takes you through detail with explanations while TaxCut just has you fill in a number without a lot of explanation.  (2) One-click relevent help for each entry -- TaxCut often sends you to a generic help page that's not relevent, while TurboTax usually gives you immediate specific details about that particular line.  The TaxCut online help is poor. (3) One-click access to itemized lists.  Both products let you enter a mini-spreadsheet to sum totals for any entry.  But when you go to re-open a list, TurboTax takes you right to the list, while TaxCut just gives you a menu of all the lists in your return, with no hint of which is which other than Form and Line Number.  If you have a form open you can know the form and line number, but if you're in the middle of an interview screen you need to have it all memorized, or else open the lists by trial and error. (4) Import from Quicken had a number of errors which needed manual correction.

I could go on with user interface and feature deficiences, but I'll close with problems when installing updates.  I went through a lot of trouble when the product said it needed to update itself, which it proceeded to do, except the update didn't actually happen so it kept saying it still needed an update.  TaxCut support responded promptly via online chat, but gave me bad advice involving dubious system startup changes.  I actually found the solution in another one of these Amazon reviews when I did Google searches to find people who might have answers.  This burned off a number of hours I could have spent doing something else!

I do think TaxCut is adequate for relatively simple returns but I'm giving it a low 2-star rating because the alternative is quite a bit better and the prices aren't much different.

PS when comparing prices, don't forget that the cost to do STATE efile is big.  (TurboTax also dings you for state efile.) Remember that to gain the benefit of TaxCut's bundled audit assistance for your state return, you must efile.

PPS I also reviewed TurboTax 2008 when users were rebelling against the stupid pay-for-print policy.  At the time I gave them one star, but now that the policy has changed I would raise my rating, except Amazon has no way to change a rating once published.  If you happen to see both reviews, TurboTax is the better product.",original

"I have been a Quicken user for over 25 years. I was very satisfied with this product until last year when things began to unravel,
First, I couldn't balance my checkbook and my credit card accounts.
I first thought that it was my fault and started doing the calculation manually.
After many months, blaming myself, (although my manual calculations were correct) i tried to get help from Intuit.
They now don't have  a fee-for-service telephone helpline anymore - only a chat-line.
In my case they made an exception and a person from India called me. He was pretty arrogant to start with and after an hour, he declared that my database is corrupted (as if it was my fault), and that I needed to start anew.
Starting anew on a portfolio with hundreds of stocks in 3 brokerage accounts (personal, IRA and 401),  2 checking accounts and 3 credit cards is not easy.
But I spent the time to do it, just because I have had luck with this program for 25 years!
I had paid for their annual new releases for 25 years - Over $ 1,500.00 so far.
Guess what happened: under the new database I created as advised by this Quicken rep, I couldn't reconcile a credit card account again.
I am now totally convinced that Quicken 2014 has a problem. They won't even admit it.
And Now, I am pissed.

The first time I bought it was from a salon and I was a fan from the start.  For the first time ever, I finally found a nail strengthener that really works for me and, best of all, STAYS ON!  I simply apply two coats of the Nail Envy, follow that with 1-2 coats of my nail laquer color of choice, and then top it with either a second coat of clear Nail Envy or OPI Top Coat.  It makes my nails stronger and longer then they've ever been, plus I can count on it to stay for 6-8 days before needing to strip off the layers and start over.

I've successfully ordered this from Amazon with positive results.  But, unfortunately, that's not always the case lately.  Sometimes it's a close match but just different enough in its performance that I question it.  My latest order gives me no doubt, though, despite arriving in its usual original-looking box/wrapping.

"Intuit has never been very upgrade friendly. This upgrade is no different. The cloud updating feature is faster, but that's about it. In all respects it looks and acts just like Quicken 2013. Come on Intuit, provide your customers with a real upgrade path. $60+ for this is nothing but a money grab.
Unless you really want to increase the speed of your android cloud interface, walk away form this upgrade until Intuit gets real with its pricing.",original

"I had a manicure and pedicure done and I asked what product they used.  They stated ESSIE.  So I came home and wanted to see if Amazon carried the product.  I purchased four of them.  I wish I had not.  We all know pedicure's last longer and for the most we do not need to touch up our toes for awhile.  Well not the case on our fingers.  It chipped with in two days of the manicure.  I had already received my products which I ordered, so I applied the chipped nails.  The product is OK if you have time to coat at least three x's and wait to it dries.  I have inquired with others at work and they state the same thing. I suggest not to buy the product unless you have time to waste applying. Sorry for remarks, but do not want others to be disappointed. It's better to pay a higher price than to buy a less expensive product.",original

This was my first OPI Polish so I had high expectations. The Polish went on nicely but the color is not as shown. I expected a nice pink /coral color. The color is definitely more of a hot pink. So far I've had it on one day with no top coat and no chipping so far,original

"I have used this product for 14 years, always found it excellent.  I recommend it not only for personal use but for small farm business and other business activities.  Handles depreciation well and covers many other business tax matters.  I would have rated it five stars except this year the updates are 10s of meg large.  You can download the Fed and State updates directly from Intuit, but it is 54 meg.  If you only have access to dial-up, and for many of us that is all that is available, the updates will take hours, if you can stay conected.  They do offer a mailed update for free, but it has been 4 weeks and I have yet to receive it.  I finally had my daughter download the updates on her DSL and mail a CD to me.  I hope they resolve this problem next year.",original

"I'm a Security Software tech, and wanted an AV that would protect me from Ransomeware?-
I have a Fast Win7 desktop computer, with a 10k rpm Hard Drive, and 60mbps cable internet.

According to independent AVcomparitives review, my old ""Buggy"" ESET IS AV did Not protect me!
I then tried Norton Internet Security ""Premium"", and it's backup files option made it SLOW (even when disabled)!

I gave WSA a 2month try, and Hate it!-
Webroot SecureAnywhere Antivirus is Cloud based, with No data memory... files on your computer.
This means that ""every"" time I open any program/application..., it has to upload the info..., check it, then download the OK back (big lag time!).
I've tried 3 cloud based AV's, and they were All slow!

I then installed Norton Internet Security ""Standard (get Deluxe if you want it to also protect your other devices (cell...)"", with No backup...
It is Fast, and I disabled their useless Search page.
It has a fast site advisor, and scans downloads...",original

You can only use it on wet hair, and sometime it will still make it look greasy.  The smell doesn't stay on as long as I would like, but it does smell nice.",original

"I couldn't even finish it - you only need something smaller than a pea size, which is great, but it's not forgiving, it won't let you layer areas that may have received a thin layer - not friendly with most loose powders.

"TurboTax 2007 caused me hours of wasted time. If I hadn't noticed that it didn't deduct what I had entered for section 179 depreciation, then I would have paid thousands more tax. Other people had the same problem based on what I saw on their support forum. I suspect TurboTax 2008 will also have its share of bugs and problems. SO CHECK YOUR RETURN CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU FILE! Also, expect it to nickel and dime you when you want to do a relative's return (or someone else's) after you've done your own. But I'm going to be nice and give them 2 stars because the competition also has its issues.

UPDATE 2008-12-29: Policy has changed and you now get ""FREE: 5 federal e-files and unlimited printed returns included with every TurboTax 2008 product."" Thanks, Intuit, for listening and responding!

UPDATE 2008-12-30: Product does not say it is compatible with Vista 64-bit, but it seems to be working for me on Vista 64-bit.",original

"I had used Quicken for several years on the Mac, but when I switched to PC I got a free copy of Money 2004 and used that until I purchased this product. My initial reaction to Money 2004 was negative, but I got used to it over time. My new bank only provides downloads to Quicken, which makes sense given Money's extinction, forcing me to migrate back to Quicken. I can't say that I'm very impressed.

The interface is very clunky; I doubt it's improved at all in the five years I've been away. (Even Microsoft Money 2004 had a cleaner interface, and Microsoft undoubtedly improved on it over the years.) There are too many different levels of menus -- top-level, register-level, account-level, and more -- which makes use of the product confusing. The one thing I really appreciated about Quicken in the past is thankfully still there: when you balance an account, you have the option of deselecting all qualifying items and then reselecting them one at a time. (In Money 2004, you would have had to manually deselect all of the items.) This allows you to balance your account by ticking off transactions one-by-one.

The product is for some reason dependent on Internet Explorer; when I wanted to register Quicken and when I wanted to download a program update, I had to make Internet Explorer my default browser (otherwise, it's Mozilla). This is annoying, and I don't recall any other non-Microsoft product having this restriction.

I had difficulty setting up one of my banks for automatic download. This is definitely a result of the way that the bank's security is set up, but Quicken (the program; I haven't contacted technical support) has not been helpful in providing clues about how to resolve the problem. (It did provide an inconvenient workaround, but I would like the problem to be fixed.)

I do not like the way that the program promotes fee-for-service programs like billpay that you can get through Quicken.com. This is only a minor annoyance, but it's built into the program.

In all, Quicken seems like it will do the job I need it to, but it's not elegant or fun. Unfortunately, it's the only game in town.

Note that I have not used any of the features that distinguish Home & Business from its less expensive siblings, so I can't comment on them yet.",original
